	How to use D3</h1>

	<h2>
		Document Driven Development to the rescue</h2>
</div>

<div id="s1" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	To maximise effectiveness, everyone in the project should be using uSDLC D<sup>3</sup>. Because how it is used
	depends on who is using it, the rest of this section looks at usage dependending on member job description.</p>
</div>
<div id="s3" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Customer</h1>

	<p>
		Agile methodology actively encourages full-time involvement of the consumer of the system during the development
		phases. With D<sup>3</sup> the customer can easily run up a virgin copy of uSDLC and document their vision and
		how they see the project results. Since uSDLC is browser based the Customer can have access to the document at
		any time to review progress and direction - and make notes directly as thoughts, issues or extensions arise.</p>
</div>
<div id="s4" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Project Manager</h1>

	<p>
		A project manager will more often be concerned with the reports uSDLC provided over D<sup>3</sup> functionality.
		There is a connection however. Whenever a section is added it will automatically create a task, as do activation
		links and pages - and the author for the task is recorded. Agile development advocates an iterative approach
		that delivers regularly and often, but does not measure the length of the project. A project manager in contrast
		is asked to both manager the project and provide projections on mile-stones. D<sup>3</sup> helps to reconcile
		these two approaches. The task summary report provides enough information with tasks, task status and creator to
		be able to estimate completions based on current progress. Because of task creator it is possible to measure
		customer generated changes against project staff generated discoveries.</p>
</div>
<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Business Analyst</h1>

	<p>
		uSDLC D<sup>3</sup> supports the discovery and documentation processes. All information gathered during discover
		should be recorded in uSDLC. Tables of data are later used to use real information for functionality activation.
		Customer expectations, problems with the existing processes and needs are recorded as always (but in uSDLC) to
		later be instrumented to exercise the related production code.</p>
</div>
<div id="s6" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Architect</h1>

	<p>
		Documentation generated as part of the architectural design process does not become an artifact if entered into
		uSDLC for D<sup>3</sup> activation. In addition it can be more closely integrated with business requirements and
		analsysis documentation.</p>
</div>
<div id="s7" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Team Lead</h1>

	<p>
		uSDLC automatically generates tasks from sections that have not been activated, assigned,completed or later fail
		due to system changes. The Team leader uses the tasks view to prioritise and assign work. As the team lead often
		holds the technical vision, they will often be the one to activate D<sup>3</sup> sections - or at least delegate
		and review.Their world becomes more document centric - but in a good way as D<sup>3</sup> also provides
		information for project managers and developers to do their work without taking more team lead time.
		D<sup>3</sup> allows distributed teams and open source projects to work more effectively.</p>

	<a href="SoftwareDesigner/index.html" id="s12a0" class="usdlc" action="page">Software Designer</a></h1>
</div>
<div id="s8" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Developer</h1>

	<p>
		For the developer, D<sup>3</sup> provides all the benefits of test driven development and behaviour driven
		development while also giving them a better perspective of the project as a while and how their current work
		fits into it. Some changes in procedures are needed. Developers are responsible for discovery - finding
		secondary code that needs to be written to support the current primary target. It is important that additional
		sections are written to document the discovery before it is implemented.</p>
</div>
<div id="s9" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Testers</h1>

	<p>
		Testing staff will be able to focus on their primary goal - to ensure that the software works as needed. With
		D<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;the expected results are well documented. Activated documentation means that most of the core
		and regression testing is covered.</p>
</div>
<div id="s11" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Technical Writer</h1>

	<p>
		D<sup>3</sup> frees technical writers to write. The document is already there. All the information is already
		there. But it will be disorganised and often poorly written. A technical writer can practice their art rather
		than testing unfinished software or guessing what funcitonality is or will be available.</p>
</div>
<div id="s10" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Support Staff</h1>

	<p>
		Support alway complain (with good reason) that they have been given an unfinished product with out-of-date
		documentation. With D<sup>3</sup> in play not only will they know what they are getting, they will be able to
		keep it up to date with any changes or fixes to the system. And since it is easy to implement changes through
		uSDLC there is no reason for documentation to ever be out of date.</p>
