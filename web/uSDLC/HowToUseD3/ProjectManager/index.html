	A project manager will more often be concerned with uSDLC reports over functionality. There is a connection. Whenever a section is added it will automatically create a task, as do activation links and pages - and the author for the task is recorded. Agile development advocates an iterative approach that delivers regularly and often, but does not measure the length of the project. A project manager in contrast is asked to both manager the project and provide projections on mile-stones. uSDLC&nbsp;helps to reconcile these two approaches.</p>

	The task summary report provides enough information with tasks, task status and creator to be able to estimate completions based on current progress. Because of task creator it is possible to measure customer generated changes against project staff generated discoveries.</p>

	Project management tools are many and prescribed. By linking to them and resulting report from uSDLC, all the information is available to everyone.</p>
