 <p> uSDLC&nbsp;supports the discovery and documentation processes. All information gathered during discovery are recorded in uSDLC. Tables of data collected are valuable during development and test. Customer expectations, problems with the existing processes and needs are recorded as always (but in uSDLC) to later be instrumented to exercise the related production code.</p>

<div id="s4" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> The analyst can continue to use the tools they prefer. If a spread-sheet is the preferred data capture tool, just link it to the matching uSDLC project page. When the page is later instrumented, the test code can read the spreadsheet for test data to inject into the production code.</p>
