 <h1> The Customer</h1> 
 <h2> is always right even when...</h2>

 <p> Agile methodology actively encourages full-time involvement of the consumer of the system during the development phases. With uSDLC&nbsp;the customer can easily run up a virgin copy of uSDLC and document their vision and how they see the project results. Since uSDLC is browser based the Customer can have access to the document at any time to review progress and direction - and make notes directly as thoughts, issues or extensions arise.</p> 
</div>
<div id="s4" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> This won't sit well with many projects. Many project managers and some technical leads like to keep control of who knows what. uSDLC has an authorisation system. While it is intended to protect document integrity it can be used, if it must be, to hide parts of the document from prying eyes.</p>

<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <blockquote> 
  <p> <em>Who is on first, What is on second and I don't know is in third.</em></p>

<div id="s6" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> <strong>uSDLC</strong> is about connecting the dots. The customer does not often want to see the source or test code. They will derive comfort for knowing it is there and that they can look at it.</p> 
 <p> More importantly, uSDLC provides BI reports that will help the customer understand progress - and incidently reduce Project Manager reporting load.</p> 
</div>
<div id="s7" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> <strong>uSDLC</strong> is about feedback. It has a task management system. If a developer requires additional information he passes the task back to his team lead. In some cases it may need to be passed all the way back to a customer representative for resolution before springing back to the developer for implementation.</p>
