 <p> For the developer, uSDLC&nbsp;provides all the benefits of test driven development and behaviour driven development while also giving them a better perspective of the project as a whole and how their current work fits into it. Some changes in procedures are needed. Developers are responsible for discovery - finding secondary code that needs to be written to support the current primary target. It is important that additional sections are written to document the discovery before it is implemented.</p>
