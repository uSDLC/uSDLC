<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Edit Mode</p>

	<p>
		Double-clicking on a section in edit mode will edit that section. Clicking on an actor link or double-clicking
		on the actor code (if visible) will edit the actor code.</p>
</div>
<div id="s6" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Run Mode</p>

	<p>
		Double-clicking on a section in run mode will run all actors in the section. Single-clicking an actor link or
		double-clicking a visible actor code display will run that individual actor. Selecting run mode will always
		clear all results from the page - allowing any previously run section or actor to run again. Edit/Run modes are
		sticky. If you are in run mode it will stay in run mode, displaying the same indicators, as you move pages.</p>

<div id="s7" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Clear Results</h1>

	<p>
		Once the current page is run, it's results are available for display by clicking the individual links. The same
		goes for running a single actor link. If you want to run an individual link again, press the "Clear Results"
		button first.</p>
