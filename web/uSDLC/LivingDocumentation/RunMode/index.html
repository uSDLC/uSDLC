<div id="s2" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Pages can be in edit or run mode. The latter activates links and commands that connect the documentation context to
	the system under review.</p>
</div>
<div id="s3" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h3>
	Links</h3>

	<p>
		Most of the activity that constitutes a page run happens through links. Links can be to other pages, scripts or
		data.</p>
</div>
<div id="s4" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h5>
	Absolute Links</h5>

	<p>
		Absolute links - whether to&nbsp;<a href="http://google.com" id="s5a0">another site</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a
			href="/idontexist.groovy" id="s5a1" class="usdlc sourceLink" action="consumer">within uSDLC</a> are treated
		like any
		other web application - click on them to follow them. They are not followed as part of the run. When running
		this page, neither of the two links in this paragraph should cause an error.</p>
</div>
<div id="s6" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h4>
	Page Links</h4>

	<p>
		Page links end in .html or specify the domain. A page link can also be generated with code by having an
		additional server extension. index.html.groovy will expect the matching groovy code to produce HTML to populate
		the page content.</p>
</div>
<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h5>
	Relative Links</h5>

	<p>
		<a class="usdlc" href="RelativeLinks/index.html" id="s6a2" action="consumer">Relative links</a> do not have a
		domain and do not start with a slash (/). They are followed, and the contents run. This link is a page that
		should mark as a pass during a test run. Note that it is created by clicking the link icon on the editor
		tool-bar. Leave the type as local and enter the name as a sentence. For this example, <em>Relative links</em>
		was typed in. On save this translates to <span style="color:#0000cd;">./RelativeLinks/index.html</span>. If you
		want to specify a different directory or a file in the current directory, specify it fulling (as in<span
			style="color:#0000cd;"> RelativeLinks.html</span> or <span
			style="color:#0000cd;">myTests/RelativeLinks.html</span>)</p>
</div>
<div id="s7" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h4>
	Scripts</h4>

	<p>
		uSDLC supports numerous scripting languages. Links to scripts are of the form <span style="color:#0000cd;">name.client.server</span>&nbsp;so
		that we can define action on both sides of the divide. A file <span
			style="color:#0000cd;">myScript.js.groovy</span> will run a groovy script that is expected to send
		javascript back to the server. To produce a script that responds with HTML, either don't give it a client
		extension or use <span style="color:#0000ff;">.htm</span>. Scripts can be free-standing, producers or consumers.
	</p>
</div>
<div id="s8" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h5>
	Free-Standing Scripts</h5>

	<p>
		Any script not in a table is run as a free-standing script. It is executed and the results returned to the
		browser in a form defined in the client extension. This <a class="usdlc" href="redHeading.js.groovy" id="s8a3"
		                                                           action="runnable">script</a> will change the page
		heading to red. This <a class="usdlc" href="checkRedHeading.js" id="s8a4" action="runnable">script</a> is purely
		client-side and will check to make sure the heading is red.</p>

	<p>
		Most scripts will call a server-side actor to interact with the system under review. Once a script has been run
		any responses will display on a pop-up window. Clicking on a script that has already been run will redisplay the
		results window. To run again go to edit mode and back to run mode. <a href="standAloneScript.htm.groovy"
		                                                                      id="s8a2" class="usdlc" action="runnable">This
		script</a> is a groovy actor that will display a simple message. Note that the link changes colour during and
		after the script has been run.</p>
</div>
<div id="s9" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h5>
	Producers</h5>

	<p>
		Scripts that returns content (htm, xml, txt, etc) are producers. For free-standing scripts, this is only visual
		- hover over the link after a run to see the results. A .<a class="usdlc sourceLink"
		                                                            href="standAloneTest.htm.groovy" id="s9a5"
		                                                            action="consumer">htm</a> result can also
		be active in that script tags are run. This is the normal type of result returned by tests.</p>

	<p>
		More commonly producers are in tables - other than column 1 if it is a heading column (reserved for
		consumers).</p>
</div>
<div id="s10" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h5>
	Consumers</h5>

	<p>
		If a script is in column one of a table and that is a heading column it is treated as a consumer. The scripts in
		the other columns of the same row are executed first and their output is collected and sent to the consumer as
		the body of a post. Any text in producer cells is sent as well. The example below will send an XML and HTML
		portion - the latter with additional static text. The consumer will check the results for validity. After
		running the section will green-line and hovering over the consumer will show the result. Note that the first
		producer is static data, not a script. Go to edit mode to look at the code and data...</p>
