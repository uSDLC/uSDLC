<div id="s2" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Pages can be in edit or run mode. The latter activates links and commands that connect the documentation context to
	the system under review.</p>
</div>
<div id="s3" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h3>
	Links</h3>

	<p>
		Most of the activity that constitutes a page run happens through links. Links can be to other pages, scripts or
		data.</p>
</div>
<div id="s4" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h5>
	Absolute Links</h5>

	<p>
		Absolute links - whether to&nbsp;<a href="http://google.com" id="s5a0">another site</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a
			href="/idontexist.groovy" id="s5a1" class="usdlc sourceLink">within uSDLC</a> are treated
		like any
		other web application - click on them to follow them. They are not followed as part of the run. When running
		this page, neither of the two links in this paragraph should cause an error.</p>
</div>
<div id="s6" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h4>
	Page Links</h4>

	<p>
		Page links end in .html or specify the domain. A page link can also be generated with code by having an
		additional server extension. index.html.groovy will expect the matching groovy code to produce HTML to populate
		the page content. Page link decorations will match the state of pages and links of children - being purple if
		not hooked up, red if a child has not passed or green otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h5>
	Relative Links</h5>

	<p>
		<a class="usdlc" href="RelativeLinks/index.html" id="s6a2">Relative links</a> do not have a
		domain and do not start with a slash (/). They are followed, and the contents run. This link is a page that
		should mark as a pass during a test run. Note that it is created by clicking the link icon on the editor
		tool-bar. Leave the type as local and enter the name as a sentence. For this example, <em>Relative links</em>
		was typed in. On save this translates to <span style="color:#0000cd;">./RelativeLinks/index.html</span>. If you
		want to specify a different directory or a file in the current directory, specify it fulling (as in<span
			style="color:#0000cd;"> RelativeLinks.html</span> or <span
			style="color:#0000cd;">myTests/RelativeLinks.html</span>)</p>
</div>
<div id="s7" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h4>
	Actors</h4>

	<p>
		uSDLC supports actors numerous scripting languages. Links to scripts are of the form <span
			style="color:#0000cd;">name.client.server</span>&nbsp;so that we can define action on both sides of the
		divide. A file <span style="color:#0000cd;">myScript.js.groovy</span> will run a groovy script that is expected
		to send javascript back to the server. To produce a script that responds with HTML, either don't give it a
		client extension or use <span style="color:#0000ff;">.htm</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="s15" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><h2>
	Actor Link Decoration</h2>

	<p>
		When you create a link to an actor you will see a purple underline. This indicates that the underlying actor has
		not been created. Once it has been created it will have a red underline until it returns a success. Currently
		successful links will have a green underline. Attempting to run a <a class="usdlc"
		                                                                     href="ScriptThatDoesNotExistWillRaiseAFailure.htmlunit"
		                                                                     id="s15a0" action="runnable">script that
		does not exist will raise a failure</a>.</p>
</div>

	Script Activation</h2>

	<p>
		<a class="usdlc" href="ClickingOnAScriptLink.htmlunit" id="s13a0" action="runnable">Clicking on a actor link</a>
		will cause the script to run. To edit the script instead, hold the <a class="usdlc" href="AltKeyToEdit.htmlunit"
		                                                                      id="s13a1" action="runnable">Alt key</a>
		down before selecting the link. Hovering over a link will provide reminder text for this functionality.</p>
</div>
<div id="s14" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h2>
	Actor Parameters</h2>

	<p>
		Links can provide script specific parameters. Other parameters are provided by the environment. All scripts are
		provided a parameter called <a class="usdlc" href="ScriptIdParameter.htmlunit" id="s14a0"
		                               action="runnable">id</a> that uniquely specifies the source for the link in the
		form page.path.s1a1, being the path to the page followed by the section number and link number within the
		section.</p>

	<p>
		The <em>event </em>parameter defines how the actor was triggered - <a href="PageLoadEvent.htmlunit" id="s14a1"
		                                                                      class="usdlc"
		                                                                      action="runnable">pageLoad</a>, <a
			href="RunEvent.htmlunit" id="s14a2" class="usdlc" action="runnable">run</a> or <a href="ClickEvent.htmlunit"

		                                                                                      action="runnable">click</a>.

<div id="s12" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><h2>
	<a class="usdlc" href="InLineSciptDisplay.htmlunit" id="s12a0" action="runnable">In-Line Actor Display</a></h2>

	<p>
		If a section consists of only one link and that to a script, the source to the script is displayed on the link
		page. This is useful for software systems documentation where the source is integral to the book.</p>

<div id="s17" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Editing an Actor Script</h1>

	<p>
		For developers we recommend adding uSDLC to your IDE project. That way you can make use of the advanced IDE
		editing features. For quick changes or tests outside a development environment, uSDLC integrates a source code
		editor, <a href="http://www.cdolivet.com/index.php?page=editArea&amp;sess=2e35fca6b6217c9cd20753a2a5ad4fc8"
		           id="s17a0">EditArea</a>. For many languages, <a href="AutoFormatting.htmlunit" id="s17a1"
		                                                           class="usdlc" action="runnable">auto-formatting</a>
		and <a href="CodeCompletion.htmlunit" id="s17a2" class="usdlc" action="runnable">code completion</a> are turned
		on.</p>
</div>
<div id="s16" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><h2>
	Actor Input</h2>

	<p>
		A free-standing actor will be passed the content of the <a href="SurroundingSectionAsInput.htmlunit" id="s16a0"
		                                                           class="usdlc" action="runnable">surrounding section
		as input</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="s11" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><h2>
	Actor Output</h2>

	<p>
		Actors&nbsp;provide some sort of feedback. They can act as sources for other scripts, provide pass of fail
		behaviour or display information to the user. In most cases this feedback only becomes available once the script
		has completed operations and sent a response to the browser. Longer running scripts can also provide progress
		information by <a class="usdlc" href="WritingToStandardError.htmlunit" id="s11a0" action="runnable">writing to
		standard error</a>. If this information is detected, it will be displayed on the uSDLC console - as set to a
		window or frame that appears during the run and is hidden again once the script has completed.</p>
</div>
<div id="s8" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h2>
	Free-Standing Actors</h2>

	<p>
		Any script not in a table is run as a free-standing script. It is executed and the results returned to the
		browser in a form defined in the client extension. This <a action="runnable" class="usdlc"
		                                                           href="RedHeading.js.groovy" id="s8a3">script</a> will
		change the page heading to red. This <a action="runnable" class="usdlc" href="CheckRedHeading.js" id="s8a4">script</a>
		is purely client-side and will check to make sure the heading is red.</p>

	<p>
		Most scripts will call a server-side actor to interact with the system under review. Once a script has been run
		any responses will display on a pop-up window. Clicking on a script that has already been run will redisplay the
		results window. To run again go to edit mode and back to run mode. <a action="runnable" class="usdlc"
		                                                                      href="StandAloneScript.htm.groovy"
		                                                                      id="s8a2">This script</a> is a groovy
		actor that will display a simple message. Note that the link changes colour during and after the script has been
		run.</p>
