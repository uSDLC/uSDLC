	Why are reports under navigation? Because they are primarily another way of getting around. While reports can be
	used by management to review project progress, their main value is in defining what needs doing, by who and
	when.</p>

<div id="s2" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Inactive Sections</h1>

	<p>
		Any section that does not have a class that excludes activation is expected to have links to actors that define
		and review system behaviour as documented in the section.</p>
