 <h1> The Index Tree</h1> 
 <h2> Hitch-hiker's Guide</h2> 
</div> 
<div id="s1" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> In the standard layout, the index is to the left of the contents. It contants links to every page in the document allowing for direct navitation.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s4" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> Every page in a uSDLC document that is referenced in a parent document will be displayed in the index tree in the order they appear on the parent page.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> Removing the link to a page will make it inaccessable from the document. The page will still exist in the document and be opened by direct url - or by adding a link again.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s6" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> Because the index tree is dynamically loaded, no unopened branch knows whether it has any children. When you open a branch, it's children are displayed if they exist - otherwise the opening handle is greyed out.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s7" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> As you move, cut and paste sections in a document that hold links, the index will update so that the index will reflect the document structure every time updates occur.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s3" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> When you open or close the tree, this status is <a class="usdlc" href="SavedByTheBrowser.groovy" id="s3a0" action="runnable">saved by the browser</a>. On <a class="usdlc" href="Reopening.groovy" id="s3a1" action="runnable">re-opening</a> the page you will be presented with the same structure and active page as when you last used it on this machine. The page open for the last session will re-open and be highlighed in the index.</p>
