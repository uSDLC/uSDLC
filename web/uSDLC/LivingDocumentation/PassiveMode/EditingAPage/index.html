<div id="s9" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	The context menu can be used to insert a new blank section relative to the section in focus. Ctrl-I is the shortcut
	to insert a new section above, while Ctrl-A will append the new section below the focus.</p>
</div>
<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	When creating a new page a single empty section will come for free. Clicking on this or any section will give it
	focus and highlight colouring.</p>
</div>
<div id="s8" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	To edit the contents of a section, double-click on it or right-click for the context menu and select Edit Section or
	press control-E. The current contents of the section are loaded into a powerful wysiwig editor called CKEdit. A
	section can be of any size, but convention and convenience limit the normal section to one paragraph or equivalent.
	Once you leave the editor the focus is placed on this new section.</p>

<div id="s3" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<a class="usdlc" href="The Clipboard/index.html" id="s3a0" action="page">The Clipboard</a></p>

<div id="s13" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<a href="Creating Links/index.html" id="s13a0" class="usdlc" action="page">Creating Links</a></p>
</div>
<div id="s9" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Sections can be moved around the page by either dragging them with the mouse or by holding the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key down
	and using the up or down arrow keys to push the highlight section up or down the stack. In all cases the focus stays
	with the section being moved.</p>
</div>
<div id="s10" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Sections can be merged by holding down the &lt;Alt&gt; key along with the up and down arrows to merge the focus with
	the section above or below. The merged section gains the highlight.</p>
</div>
<div id="s11" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	A section can be turned into a new page from the context menu or with Ctrl-T. The first paragraph or heading becomes
	the title, while the rest of the contents becomes the first paragraph. The new page will use the same name as the
	title - with spaces removed. A reference to the new page is kept in the parent. The index is updated.</p>
</div>
<div id="s12" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Sometimes it is useful to enter a list of items and break them up into sections later. The breaking up can be
	achieved with a context menu command or the Ctrl-S key. If the content is made up of a numbered or bullet list, each
	item is given it's own section. Otherwise each paragraph becomes a section. This is a useful technique for entering
	information from emails or other external sources.</p>
