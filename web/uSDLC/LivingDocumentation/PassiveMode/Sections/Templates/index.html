<div id="s1" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	uSDLC templates do not add anything except convention to the system. Any page anywhere can be a template holder.
	uSDLC comes installed with a template page at the global level. For many projects a private template set may also be
	of benefit.</p>
</div>
<div id="s3" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	A template can be created directly in a templates page, just as you would any other section. Alternatively you can
	copy and paste sections from other parts of the document.</p>
</div>
<div id="s4" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	To use a template, go to a template page, highlight a template and copy it from the drop-down menu or with ^C. It
	will stay in your clipboard until you paste it at the destination.</p>
</div>
<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Templates can be parameterised. When creating a section, add variables with the pattern ${Parameter Name}. Put a
	back-slash before the dollar to revert to normal text. When pasting a template (or any section) with parameters, the
	user will be presented with a form with one entry field per parameter. Historical data for each parameter is kept
	and used for auto-completion.</p>
</div>
<div id="s6" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Go to the <em>Templates</em> section near the bottom of the index for a list of sample templates you can customsize.
