 <h1> Section Classes</h1> 
 <h2> Yes, but what do I really mean?</h2> 
</div> 
<div id="s1" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> Every section has a class - some implicit based on location and content, others explicit. There are classes for synopses, notes, to-do lists, assignments and data.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s2" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section">
 <h2> <a class="usdlc" href="SynopsisClass.htmlunit" id="s2a0" action="runnable">Synopsis Class</a></h2> 
 <p> The first section on a page is an implicit Synopsis class. It should not have internal links and will display on the parent page as a summary of this book section. It has a cream background by default.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s3" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section">
 <h2> <a class="usdlc" href="MarginNoteClass.htmlunit" id="s3a0" action="runnable">Margin Note Class</a></h2> 
 <p> These sections will not become part of the book if one is created. In many reproductions (such as PDF) they will become part of the note system. By default the background is a burnt orange.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s4" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section">
 <h2> <a class="usdlc" href="AlertClass.htmlunit" id="s4a0" action="runnable">Alert Class</a></h2> 
 <p> Sections with this class are not part of the finished document. They are there as place-markers for tasks that are not yet fleshed out.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s5" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section">
 <h2> <a href="ImplementClass.htmlunit" id="s5a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable">Implement Class</a></h2> 
 <p> Classes that are ready for immediate implementation.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s6" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section">
