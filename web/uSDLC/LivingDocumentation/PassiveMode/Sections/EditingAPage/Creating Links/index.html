	Creating Links</h1>

<div id="s1" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	To create a link to a child page, use the link tool on the editor bar.</p>
</div>
<div id="s7" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Use the local link protocol for <strong><span style="color:#220000;">D<sup>3</sup></span></strong> internal
	operations. When you <a href="Highlight.groovy" id="s7a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable">highlight</a> text it will
	use this to fill the address box. The <a class="usdlc" href="RadioButtons.groovy" id="s7a0" action="runnable">radio
	buttons</a> below the name field select the link type - child page, actor, etc. If an actor is chosen you can <a
		class="usdlc" href="SelectTheLanguage.groovy" id="s7a1" action="runnable">select the language</a>/system to use.&nbsp;<strong><span
		style="color: rgb(34, 0, 0); ">D<sup>3</sup></span></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;will <a class="usdlc"
	                                                                                    href="Remember.groovy" id="s7a2"
	                                                                                    action="runnable">remember</a>
	your selection.</p>
</div>
<div id="s2" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><p>
	The editor link menu defaults to local - the mode to use to navigate internally within the document. For child
	pages, just copy and paste the link text into the URL field. uSDLC will take the effort to convert this into a <a
		class="usdlc" href="ReadableLink.groovy" id="s2a0" action="runnable">readable link</a> and connected page. It
	removes spaces from the link url, creates a matching path and prepares for an index.html for page content.</p>

</div>
<div id="s3" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	If a page in the same directory as the parent is required, add&nbsp;<u>.html</u>&nbsp;to the end of the link name.
</p>
</div>
<div id="s4" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	You can refer to pages at other locations in the document by giving a full url relative to the domain (being one
	that starts with /). These can be obtains by copying direct links to these pages from their parent.</p>
</div>
<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	To open other documents or any web page, use a full url - one starting with http:// or https://.</p>
</div>
<div id="s6" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Links are also used to reference actors - the code modules used to activate a uSDLC document. An actor has an
	extension that indicates the language to be used - as in .java or .groovy. Actors have have another extension
	indicating the client presentation. The form of an actor url is <u>name.clientExt.serverExt</u>. If the client
	extension is <u>.html</u>, the page is treated and document content - otherwise as actions.&nbsp;</p>
