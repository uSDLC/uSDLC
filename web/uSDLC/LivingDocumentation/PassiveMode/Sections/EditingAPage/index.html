 <h1> Editing a Page</h1> 
 <h2> Mastering the Word Jigsaw</h2> 
</div> 
<div id="s1" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> Almost all page editing is about creating, editing or moving sections.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s9" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section">
 <h3> Inserting a New Section</h3> 
 <p> The context menu can be used to <a href="InsertANewBlankSection.htmlunit" id="s9a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable">insert a new blank section</a> relative to the section in focus. Ctrl-I is the shortcut to insert a new section above, while Ctrl-A will append the new section below the focus.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s5" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section">
 <h3> A New Page</h3> 
 <p> When creating a new page a <a class="usdlc" href="SingleEmptySection.htmlunit" id="s5a0" action="runnable">single empty section</a> will come for free. Clicking on this or any section will give it focus and highlight colouring.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s17" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <h2> The Title Section</h2> 
 <p> The title section can be edited in the same fashion as content sections. It does have a more limited context menu.</p>

</div> 
<div id="s14" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section">
 <h2> Uploading Images</h2> 
 <p> The easiest way to add images from a brower based page is to use copy and paste. CKEdit puts a reference to the image into the HTML. This is not suitable if the original page is not available. It is often best to carry the image with the document. The image dialog includes an <a href="UploadButton.htmlunit" id="s14a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable">upload button</a>. Click this and browse for the image you want to display.</p> 
</div>

</div> 
<div id="s19" class="editable section running" contextmenu="section">
 <h3> Moving Sections</h3> 
 <p> Sections can be moved around the page by either <a class="usdlc" href="Dragging.htmlunit" id="s19a0" action="runnable">dragging</a> them with the mouse or by holding the &lt;<a class="usdlc" href="CtrlKey.htmlunit" id="s9a1" action="runnable">Ctrl</a>&gt; key down and using the up or down arrow keys to push the highlight section up or down the stack. In all cases the <a class="usdlc" href="FocusStays.htmlunit" id="s9a2" action="runnable">focus stays</a> with the section being moved. To abort once a drag has started, use the &lt;<a class="usdlc" href="Escape.htmlunit" id="s9a3" action="runnable">Esc</a>&gt; key.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s11" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <h3> Convert Section to Page</h3> 
 <p> A section can be turned into a <a class="usdlc" href="NewPage.htmlunit" id="s11a0" action="runnable">new page</a> from the context menu or with <a class="usdlc" href="CtrlT.htmlunit" id="s11a1" action="runnable">Ctrl-T</a>. The <a class="usdlc" href="FirstParagraph.htmlunit" id="s11a2" action="runnable">first paragraph</a> or heading becomes the title, while the rest of the contents becomes the first paragraph. The new page will use the same name as the title - with spaces removed. A <a class="usdlc" href="Reference.htmlunit" id="s11a3" action="runnable">reference</a> to the new page is kept in the parent. The <a class="usdlc" href="IndexIsUpdated.htmlunit" id="s11a4" action="runnable">index is updated</a>. </p> 
</div> 
<div id="s10" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <h3> Merging Sections</h3> 
 <p> Sections can be <a class="usdlc" href="Merged.htmlunit" id="s10a0" action="runnable">merged</a> by holding down the &lt;Alt&gt; key along with the up and down arrows to merge the focus with the section above or below. <a class="usdlc" href="TheMergedSectionGainsTheHighlight.htmlunit" id="s10a1" action="runnable">The merged section gains the highlight</a>.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s12" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <h3> Creating Sections from A List</h3> 
 <p> Sometimes it is useful to enter a list of items and break them up into sections later. The breaking up can be achieved with a context menu command or the Ctrl-S key. If the content is made up of a numbered or <a class="usdlc" href="BulletList.htmlunit" id="s12a0" action="runnable">bullet list</a>, each item is given it's own section. The final page structure will reflect a <a class="usdlc" href="MultiLevelList.htmlunit" id="s12a1" action="runnable">multi-level list</a>. Otherwise each <a class="usdlc" href="ParagraphBecomesASection.htmlunit" id="s12a2" action="runnable">paragraph becomes a section</a>. This is a useful technique for entering information from emails or other external sources.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s15" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <h1> Page Locking</h1> 
 <p> When a user chooses to edit a section it is locked. Others may edit other sections. They will be given a message if they attempt to edit a locked section. If a page has changed in the time between a user has loaded it and they choose to edit, insert, move or delete a section then it will be reloaded prior to the operation. If the section being manipulated has been deleted, an error message is displayed.</p> 
 <p> A section lock is held until the user saves the section being edited or loads another resource. If a lock is over 1 hour in age, anyone who gets a waiting for lock dialog can also choose to over-ride the lock and edit anyway. The authorisation system has an optimistic group. Anyone in this group is allowed to over-ride a lock at any time.</p> 
 <p> Internally page changes are queued and applied in order of submission.</p> 
 <p> Attempting to save a section on a page where the lock has been over-ridden will display an error dialog. The section that could not be updated is placed in the clipboard for re-use.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s18" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
