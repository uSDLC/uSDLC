		<em>Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
		Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
		Simple is better than complex.<br>
		Complex is better than complicated.<br>
		Flat is better than nested.<br>
		Sparse is better than dense.<br>
		Readability counts.<br>
		Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
		Although practicality beats purity.<br>
		Errors should never pass silently.<br>
		Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
		In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
		There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
		Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br>
		Now is better than never.<br>
		Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
		If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
		If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
		Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</em></p>
