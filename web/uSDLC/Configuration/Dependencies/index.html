 <h2> Code, Libraries and Sub-systems we can use</h2>

<div id="s1" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> uSDLC can use any of a large number of systems to integrate development and the rest of the SDLC. If your code is dependent on one of these systems, you can use these pages to get them and keep them up to date. JVM based dependencies, including source and documentation are mostly serviced from Maven repositories with Ivy. Other dependecies are downloaded and installed directly.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s2" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section">
 <p> If you attempt to run an actor that has a registered dependency that has not yet been initialised, you will get a <a action="runnable" class="usdlc" href="DependencyPopUp.htmlunit" id="s2a0">pop-up</a> with a link to load it (and it's dependencies) into the system.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s3" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> To update dependencies, click on the spanner on the tool-bar and select the page of the same name. You can<a href="RunThePage.htmlunit" id="s3a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable"> run the page</a> to update all dependencies &nbsp;that are marked as required or previously loaded. You can also <a href="LoadNewDependencies.htmlunit" id="s3a1" class="usdlc" action="runnable">load new dependencies</a> by running their link.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s4" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> There are <a href="DependencySectionTemplates.htmlunit" id="s4a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable">dependency section templates</a> to ease the adding of new sources. Right-click on a blank section and select Template / Dependency Type. <a href="ExistingDependencySections.htmlunit" id="s4a1" class="usdlc" action="runnable">Existing dependency sections</a> can be updated the same way.</p> 
</div> 
<div id="s5" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section">
 <p> Downloading dependencies can take quite some time. uSDLC does provide a <a href="FeedbackBar.htmlunit" id="s5a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable">feedback bar</a> to provide some information on progress.</p>
