	The Basics</h1>

	<h2>
		of Document Driven Development</h2>
</div>

<div id="s3" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Discard your preconceptions. Document Driven Development (D3) is not about having to write or read reams of
	documents. It is about the glue that binds the life-cycle of a project together to make everyone’s job a little
	easier.</p>
</div>
<div id="s4" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	For D3 to be feasible it needs a supporting system similar to a content management system or wiki. It differs in
	that it requires that every paragraph, every spreadsheet and all supporting data to be activated. This means that
	they will be attached to supporting code that will exercise the related areas in the system being developed.</p>
</div>
<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<strong>Management</strong> at last get what they have always wanted – cohesive complete documents that remain
	up-to-date for the life of the project.</p>
</div>
<div id="s6" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<strong>Project Managers</strong> will be able to extract meaningful statistics to measure the progress of a project
	– even when that project is completely agile.</p>
</div>
<div id="s7" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<strong>Business Analysts</strong> have a medium to store the results of their studies in a way that will ensure
	that the implemented system meets the requirements they have uncovered.</p>
</div>
<div id="s8" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<strong>Architects</strong> can be assured that their designs and documentation will be used as every paragraph is
	flagged until activated.</p>
</div>
<div id="s9" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<strong>Team Leads</strong> have clear reports on what work is to be done with sufficient detail for implementation.
	Unstarted and assigned sections are marked for report but not activated during continuous integration.</p>
</div>
<div id="s10" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<strong>Developers</strong> can work to clear requirements and know when a task is done.</p>
</div>
<div id="s11" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<strong>Test Personnel</strong> are involved much earlier in the project to help analysts and architects to activate
	the document as it is being produced.</p>
</div>
<div id="s12" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<strong>Technical Writers</strong> have all the information they need to produce supporting documentation. They can
	also be involved earlier in the project to own the clarity of the D3 document.</p>
</div>
<div id="s13" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<strong>Support Staff</strong> have clear documented and tested systems that lend themselves to safe support and
	extension.</p>
</div>
<div id="s14" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	D3 supports lean and agile methodologies across the software development life-cycle. This is much more powerful that
	limiting those methodologies to the build phase alone. D3 breaks down the barriers between design, implementation
	and release.</p>
