	A History of Document Driven Development</h1>

		Everything and everyone has a history</h2>

<div id="s1" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Since the first software development projects, we have been generating documents as artefacts – more often as a
	project deliverable than providing more than minimal effect on the project direction.</p>
</div>
<div id="s3" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
	For waterfall projects (and the parts of agile projects that remain waterfall) the documents are the glue across the
	SDLC. They are still artefacts and rarely resemble the final product. Without the engineering principle of a
	feedback loop, document artefacts become out of date and untrustworthy.
</div>
<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
	The agile manifesto says that working software is preferable over documentation. Listen to the programmers sigh with
	relief now that they can code and not write or review documentation. How do developers on an agile project know what
	to write? By documents and verbal transfer from earlier parts of the project – often following a waterfall model. We
	have architects writing the spec document from finished and partially finished code and testers discovering what the
	system really does for both testing and final documentation.
</div>
<div id="s7" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
	Documentation has been the most hated part of any project. Everyone hates to produce it, hates to read it and avoids
	trying to keep it up to day.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="s8" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
	Documents as artefacts are not document driven development.
