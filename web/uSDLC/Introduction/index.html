	We, as a group, are doing a good job of putting processes in place that improve the performance and reliability of
	phases in the Software Development Life-cycle. The communications between the phases, however are typically
	unwieldy, expensive and ineffective. Usdlc is an attempt to address these issues by integrating best-of breed
	processes from the different phases in a platform that provides facilities for better communication.</p>

<div id="s2" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Modern software development methodologies, techniques and technologies are now ready to support the unification of
	the software development life-cycle. This system works step-by-step towards that goal. While the term SDLC is as old
	as the IT industry, it is still a valid term for encompassing all the processes that are required to create and
	maintain a software system. This system uses agile methodologies to build upon the Lean principals to reduce waste
	and increase productivity.</p>

<div id="s3" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<a href="uSDLC.groovy" id="s3a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable">uSDLC</a> is a browser based distributed system
	that can be used by all participants of a software development project. It provides integration between groups and
	stages within the SDLC.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Provide a framework to support Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) across the SDLC.
		</li>
		<li>
			Embrace Lean principles.
		</li>
		<li>
			Support agile processes.
		</li>
		<li>
			Introduce documentation to the agile and lean processes in a way that provides benefit without introducing
			waste.
		</li>
		<li>
			Leverage best-of-breed systems for better communication between the steps of the software development
			life-cycle.
		</li>
		<li>
			Minimise the waste that is incurred by loss of information between the SDLC steps.
		</li>
		<li>
			Integrate tools that are used because the benefits out-weigh the effort involved in using them.
		</li>
		<li>
			Remove the need for dead-end artifacts such as stand-alone design documents and wire-frame screen designs.
		</li>
		<li>
			Multiple instances awareness - for both information sharing and remote actioning.
		</li>
		<li>
			Generate reports that are of value to all participants.
		</li>
