	We, as a group, are doing a good job of putting processes in place that improve the performance and reliability of
	phases in the Software Development Life-cycle. The communications between the phases, however are typically
	unwieldy, expensive and ineffective. Usdlc is an attempt to address these issues by integrating best-of breed
	processes from the different phases in a platform that provides facilities for better communication.</p>

	What is uSDL?</h1>

	<p>
		<a class="usdlc" href="USDLC.groovy" id="s3a0" action="runnable">uSDLC</a> is a browser based distributed system
		that can be used by all participants of a software development project. It provides integration between groups
		and stages within the SDLC.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Provide a framework to support Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) across the SDLC.
		</li>
		<li>
			Embrace Lean principles.
		</li>
		<li>
			Support agile processes.
		</li>
		<li>
			Introduce documentation to the agile and lean processes in a way that provides benefit without introducing
			waste.
		</li>
		<li>
			Leverage best-of-breed systems for better communication between the steps of the software development
			life-cycle.
		</li>
		<li>
			Minimise the waste that is incurred by loss of information between the SDLC steps.
		</li>
		<li>
			Integrate tools that are used because the benefits out-weigh the effort involved in using them.
		</li>
		<li>
			Remove the need for dead-end artifacts such as stand-alone design documents and wire-frame screen designs.
		</li>
		<li>
			Multiple instances awareness - for both information sharing and remote actioning.
		</li>
		<li>
			Generate reports that are of value to all participants.
		</li>

	What is Document Driven Development (D<sup>3</sup>)?</h1>

	<p>
		D<sup>3</sup> is based on the tried and true engineering principle of feedback. A constant speed diesel
		generator takes feedback from a revolution counter to a throttle so that the RPM does not change wildly. Analog
		radios use feedback to keep the radio on station. In traditional software development we lack feedback. The
		vision holder instigates a project often with verbal insructions. Business analysts and various architects
		generate a plethoria of document that are artifacts - they don't change as the project progresses, aren't read
		as the software is developed and aren't trusted during deployment because they are no longer up-to-date.
		D<sup>3</sup> methodology in uSDLC is designed to provide the necessary feedback. Every paragraph of the
		document has actors that exercise the functionality discussed. Every paragraph without actors is a task waiting
		to be done. Either add actors and supporting production code or remove the paragraph as having no value to the
		project.</p>
