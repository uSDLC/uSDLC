	Features, not Bugs</h1>

	This is not an absolute. There will always be bugs, but given adequate tests and coverage, 99% of reported bugs will
	undocumented features that need to be added. This is a core tenet of Document Driven Development.</p>

	As always, the concept can be clarified with an example. While working on this page I note that once a section is
	saved the highlight is lost. I have to click on the recently saved section so I can then add a new section below it.
	As a responsible project member I should not let this pass. Depending on project policy and my knowledge of the
	document I can document my discover and thoughts for improvement either in the inbox or in the correct place in the
	document. The document, like the code, can always be refactored as needed. For the purposes of demonstration I
	designate this section on this page as the appropriate place to document the newly discovered feature that <a
		href="SavingASectionWillMakeItTheNewFocusSection.selenium" id="s2a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable">saving a
	section will make it the new focus section</a>. The uSDLC tasks system will ensure that this section is reviewed,
	actioned and implemented.</p>
