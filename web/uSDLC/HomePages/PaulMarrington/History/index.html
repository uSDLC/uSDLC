	Over the last 30 years I have working in every position available in a software development project. My largest disappointment in common across all teams was about loss of information. Unless a project is run by a small tight-knit group of peers, valuable information is lost in translation.</p>

	I often resolved or at least eased the problem by introducing feedback loops. The scope of my solutions was limited by my position in the project. The solutions required technical expertise to use. No matter how valued, the did not survive beyond the release phase.</p>

	A year ago I was applying BDD principles to a personal project. BDD, Agile and Lean all talk about client involvement in the development process. Looking at the excellent BDD offerings I saw systems designed by developers for use by developers.</p>

	I looked around and saw that open source has come of age. There are solutions to almost any problem - and problems to every solution. I started with wanting a BDD solution that was easier for non-developers to use. From there I moved onto the concept of Document Driven Development (D3) and finally to unifying the software development life-cycle.</p>
