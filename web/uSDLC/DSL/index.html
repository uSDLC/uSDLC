 <h1> Domain Specific Languages</h1>
 <h2> Making the basics simple and the complex possible</h2>

<div id="s1" contextmenu="section" class="editable section">
 <p> Domain specific languages are just a way of expressing domain knowledge in a way that the computer can work with and the domain expert understand without a degree in software engineering. It is used heavily in uSDLC to hide unnecessary scaffolding from all the domains, both business and technical that make up the software development lifecycle for a project.</p>

 <h1> What is a DSL?</h1>
 <p> For a primary DSL, the script file extension defines the name of the DSL.</p>
 <p> For external DSLs (not based on other scripting languages), the backing code is in <em>usdlc/actor/<u>Name</u>Actor.<u>lang</u></em>&nbsp;where <em>Name</em> is a capitalised extension defining the DSL and <em>lang</em> is the source language (groovy, java, scala, etc). JavaActor.groovy, for example, compiles java files if they are out of date and call the resulting class as a runnable interface.</p>
 <p> For internal DSLs (extensions of other scripting languages), the DSL description is in <em>(usdlc|web)/dsl/nameDSL.lang</em>. The script usdlc/dsl/webdriverDSL.groovy provides a simplified interface for controlling a browser from script.</p>
 <p> uSDLC uses groovy for technical DSLs and coffee-script for functional DSLs. Groovy provides a close interface to the Java and other JVM languages. For functional project members who are not software developers, coffee-script provides the cleanest and easiest DSL to understand.</p>

 <p> How to Associate with a DSL</p>
 <p> When creating a new DSL, it is necessary to tell uSDLC of the association. This is done with a static <a id="s4a0" action="runnable" class="usdlc sourceLink succeeded" href="creationMethod.groovy">creation method</a> in DSL producing an empty <em>web/dsl/nameDSL.lang</em> file. If the file already exists, it is not over-written and the method returns false.</p>
