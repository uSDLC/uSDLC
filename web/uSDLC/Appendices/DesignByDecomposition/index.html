 <h1> Design by Decomposition</h1> 
 <h2> There are 3 kinds of people - those that can count and those that can't</h2>

 <p> &quot;<em>Can't see the wood for the trees?</em>&quot; &quot;<em>Can't see the trees for the wood?</em>&quot; &quot;<em>You can't break a bundle of sticks.</em>&quot;&nbsp;We need to break down the problem, whether at project, component or item levels. I call this approach &quot;<em>Design by Decomposition</em>&quot;</p> 
</div>
<div id="s4" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> We all do it as part of the software development process. &quot;<em>Design by Decomposition</em>&quot; is an attempt to put process and structure around the technique. Like all processes in design, use it as a guideline, not a fixed rule.</p> 
</div>
<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> Search Google for &quot;<strong><em>The Rule of Threes</em></strong>&quot;. You will find examples in painting, photography, design, drama, speech writing, presentations, comedy and problem solving. Don't get lost - it makes fascinating reading.</p> 
 <p> Why is&nbsp;&quot;<em>The Rule of Threes</em>&quot;so common in human communication? Decimal is for the fingers, binary for the computer and ternary for the mind.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li> Give me a list of 10 choices and I have to re-read it over and over. Give me choices of three where the third is none of the above and I can quickly drill down.</li> 
  <li> Tell me 10 benefits of your product and I won't remember any. Tell me three and I will remember them all.</li> 
  <li> I can list my 3 favourite colours over and over consistently, but not 10. Same for food, actors or relatives :)</li> 
 </ul>

 <p> Design by Decomposition works best when married to <a href="/uSDLC/Appendices/DocumentDrivenDesign" id="s11a0" class="usdlc" action="page">Document Driven Design</a>. Think it - write it - implement it - repeat.</p>

<div id="s6" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> For a project, a sample decomposition could be:</p> 
 <ol> 
  <li> The Vision</li> 
  <li> Design 
   <ol> 
    <li> User Interfaces 
     <ol> 
      <li> Web</li> 
      <li> Mobile</li> 
      <li> Integrations</li> 
     </ol> </li> 
    <li> Business Logic 
     <ol> 
      <li> Domain Group 1</li> 
      <li> Domain Group 2</li> 
      <li> Domain Group 3</li> 
     </ol> </li> 
    <li> Data Access 
     <ol> 
      <li> Database</li>

 <p> For components and items, the groups of three are more likely to be domain specific. For an example, review &quot;<a action="page" class="usdlc" href="/uSDLC/ACaseStudy" id="s7a0"><em>A Case Study</em></a>&quot;, but I will give an example of item decomposition.</p> 
</div>
<div id="s8" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <h3> Item Decomposition</h3> 
 <p> <strong>Task</strong>: Read in CSV files and make the data available by column name. Account for large files.</p> 
 <p> <strong>Decomposition</strong>:</p> 
 <ol> 
  <li> Read a CSV file 
   <ol> 
    <li> Find and use Java library</li> 
    <li> Access CSV as a list of maps</li> 
    <li> Call closure for each row</li> 
   </ol> </li> 
  <li> Format Variations 
   <ol> 
    <li> Header Lines</li> 
    <li> Differing separator</li> 
    <li> Different quote</li> 
   </ol> </li> 
  <li> Edge conditions 
   <ol> 
    <li> Quoted items</li> 
    <li> Multi-line items</li> 
    <li> Empty file</li> 
   </ol> </li> 
 </ol>

 <p> I know it looks artificial to keep to &quot;<em>The Rules of Three</em>&quot;, but there is a benefit apart from recognition. When a level has 2 items it forces you to think of a third. When a level grows it forces a refactor into groups. Thinking is good as it highlights problems and areas that need improvement. Don't make the rule a law, but give it a go.</p>
