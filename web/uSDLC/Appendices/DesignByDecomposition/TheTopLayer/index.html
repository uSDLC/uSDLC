 <h1> The Top Layer</h1> 
 <h2> What goes where</h2> 
</div> 
<div id="s1" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <p> Whether green-field or retro-fitting uSDLC, the top layer can consistently be - <em>Vision - Design - Environment</em>.</p> 
</div>
<div id="s4" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <h3> Vision</h3> 
 <p> There is no way to start a project but with a single paragraph describing the overall vision. Once you have created your project uSDLC document, drop this paragraph into the top of the Vision section.</p> 
 <p> Next, split all your great ideas into Benefits, Features and Requirements. Stick with the “Rule of Threes” where you can – but the main thing is to move from mind to the written word before the mind moves on to new horizons.</p> 
 <p> Design is about how. Vision is about what and why. They cut across the project from different perspectives. So, when you feel the need to repeat a design definition or don’t know where a section goes in the design, it is probably better suited to the vision.</p> 
 <p> Perhaps this will be clearer with an example. “There is a countdown timer” is a benefit or a feature. If we put it into the web design, we would need to repeat ourselves in the mobile application design – and the two may not match.</p> 
 <p> Every paragraph in the vision will refer to one or more sections in Design or Environment. uSDLC creates tasks to make sure that these references exist.</p> 
</div>
<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <h3> Design</h3> 
 <p> The software application is, implemented and verified in this section. Pages in the design will be the day-to-day home of the analysts, software designers, developers and testers.</p> 
 <p> You will notice no implementation section. This is because design and implementation hold a one-to-one relationship. All implementation and test code is reference by and contained within the design. To generalise, the structure will look like:</p> 
 <blockquote> 
  <pre>design (doc) -&gt; verification (dsl) -&gt; implementation (code)</pre> 
 </blockquote> 
 <p> Of course this is over simplified - and only part of an agile development loop. In practice discoveries during implementation will cause a loop back to design to create a new or extend an existing component.</p> 
 <p> Every design page will reference to either the parent design or to a section in the vision. uSDLC check for and raises tasks if this referential integrity cannot be found.</p> 
</div>
<div id="s6" class="editable section" contextmenu="section">
 <h3> Environment</h3> 
 <p> A software application does not run in the ether (although it can run in a cloud). The environment is all the supporting ‘stuff’ – architecture, frameworks, hardware, communication…</p> 
 <p> A lot of this ‘stuff’ is defined very early in the project. It is difficult to create spikes during early design phases without knowing the platform.</p> 
 <p> It is common for architecture and environment documentation to atrophy in later stages of a project – to become (shock, horror) artifacts. This is not to be. Things change as we learn more and as time passes. Updates to a framework are much easier to maintain if earlier work is documented. Changes to the network may not reach production if done on-the-fly. uSDLC helps keep environment documentation alive by creating review tasks.</p>
