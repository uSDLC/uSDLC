	To be of most use, lessons learned need to be recorded where they will be easily found when needed. Traditionally
	developers will refer to source over documentation. This is because documentation is traditionally an artifact that
	diverges from the source as the system develops. uSDLC provides an alternative. Since all documentation refers to
	behaviours that are implemented as actors to exercise the related code, no documentation becomes an artifact. All
	documentation remains current and knowledge is created and retained.</p>
