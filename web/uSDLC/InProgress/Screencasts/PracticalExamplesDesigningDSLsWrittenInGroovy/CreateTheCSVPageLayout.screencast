prompt 'DSL Support',
    '''The clearest difference between a library and an internal DSL written in Groovy is the
    lack of scaffolding in the latter. Functionality for a DSL can all reside in script code
    that runs in the same binding as the target DSL script. In practice I prefer to separate
    DSL support by having scaffolding in the supporting code and logic in underlying classes.
