 <p> Support alway complain (with good reason) that they have been given an unfinished product with out-of-date documentation. With uSDLC&nbsp;in play not only will they know what they are getting, they will be able to keep it up to date with any changes or fixes to the system. And since it is easy to implement changes through uSDLC there is no reason for documentation to ever be out of date.</p>
