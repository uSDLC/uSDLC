<div id="s1" class="editable section">
 <p> uSDLC automatically generates tasks from sections that have not been activated, assigned,completed or later fail due to system changes. The Team leader uses the tasks view to prioritise and assign work. As the team lead often holds the technical vision, they will be the one to activate uSDLC&nbsp;sections - or at least delegate and review. Their world becomes more document centric - but in a good way as uSDLC&nbsp;also provides information for project managers and developers to do their work without taking more team lead time. uSDLC&nbsp;allows distributed teams and open source projects to work more effectively.</p>
