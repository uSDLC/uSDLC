 <h1> HtmlUnit</h1>
 <h2> Testing with a virtual browser</h2>
</div>
<div id="s3" class="editable section">
 <p> HtmlUnit runs as a mock browser that purports to do all that the real thing does. You drive it with a simple DSL describing the actions you want to perform.</p>
</div>
<div id="s2" class="editable section synopsis">
 <p> This first test is simplified - just making sure we can <a href="ClickOnSection.htmlunit" id="s2a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable">click on a section</a> of this document and make it highlight..</p>
</div>
<div id="s5" class="editable section synopsis">
 <p> A web application will provide a consistent interface. It makes sense to create classes with consistent HtmlUnit actions for re-use by actors. For uSDLC there is one called <strong>Sandbox</strong>. It can be used to manipulate uSDLC pages created and worked within the Sandbox folder. Here we open a page called <em>scratch </em>and <a class="usdlc" href="CreateANewSection.htmlunit" id="s5a0" action="runnable">create a new section</a>. Check that the HTML editor has been opened.</p>
</div>
<div id="s4" class="editable section">
 <p> HtmlUnit is available as drivers for both Selenium and Geb.</p>
