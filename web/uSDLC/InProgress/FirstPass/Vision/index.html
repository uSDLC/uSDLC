<div id="s1" class="editable section"><p>
	There is a frustrating disconnect between areas and stake-holders in the life-cycle of a software project. This leads to inefficiencies and a result that rarely meets the vision or the needs of the end users. <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em>&nbsp;is an open source project designed to reduce the disconnection in small to medium sized projects.</p>

	<span>What vision?</span></h2>
<p>
	The word vision brings up feelings of breath-taking vistas and simple clear grand statements. In truth it may be like that in the mind of the vision holder, but 'getting it out there' is more difficult. In addition a simple statement is easy to mis-interpret.</p>
<p>
	A vision is <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> parlance is more prosaic. If the vision holders can produce all the ideas that is burning in their brains then this can provide the basis from which a design can be fleshed out.</p>
<p>
	Think of a vision as a very high level design before it is catalogued and pidgeon-holed. When it comes time to clarify and record the high level design, place it on a child page. The raw clarity of the original description continues to have value.</p>

	<ul>
		<li class="li1">
			An integrated browser based content management system ready for use by all members of the teams involved in a software project.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Simplified inter and intra page navigation with trees, tasks, and searching.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			All sections in all pages can be activated. This connects the documentation for a benefit or feature directly to the software that implements it.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Tasks are generated by rules to ensure that all documentation is activated and that the activations continue to operate as expected as the software system develops.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			The tasking, documentation and activation systems provide a feedback loop that ensure that the documentation is relevant, up to date and that the code operates and continues to operate as required.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			The system includes authentication an authorisation so that users can focus on what they need. If a project manager doesn't need to see code, then turn it off.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			There are project, group and personal home/launch pages that provide useful links, task assignments and other project specific information.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			A project overview is available by using a set of internally generated reports. As uSDLC support agile development practice, reports measure discovery as well as progress to provide more information on completion than agile alone can provide.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			At the more detailed level, each page is colour coded to show work that has not been started, in progress, complete or currently non-functional.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Actors can be written in the languages of choice. Simplified domain specific languages can be used for test and support, while the developers can use the same language they used to create the software system.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Actors can involve a mixture of XML, SQL, Java, Groovy, Javascript, C#, C++ or any one of a plethora of choices.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Active sections, pages or page hierarchies can be run from a single command to provide automated or manual unit and integration level testing.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			uSDLC supports data migration directly. It can provide versioning if you are releasing system updates or it can be used to maintain and run the migration scripts. uSDLC also has a master-slave mode so that scripts can be run on the machine they are required for.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Roll-out occurs for development, test, UAT and production servers. The uSDLC master/slave support and scripting allows most roll-out tasks to be automatic with integrity checks. For required manual task, uSDLC can prompt for them to be done and then continue with validation aod further tasks.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			All tasks are recorded and reviewed for project impact. If integration testing or migration scripts start taking significantly longer, uSDLC raises a task for this to be reviewed.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Continuous performance monitoring is available. If any component starts to perform more slowly during activation or continuous integration then a task will be raised for review.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Everyone in the team benefits from a more consistent approach to the SDLC.</p>
	<ul class="ul1">
		<li class="li1">
			The project owner or customer can alway view the state of the project by reviewing the documentation and reports that uSDLC automatically generates.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Project managers have the reports they need to be able to plan project schedules.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Analysts and architects have an integrated tool that allows their documentation to be complete, available and implemented.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Discoveries made by analysts are not lost - they are used to activate and confirm software implementation.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Team leads can create, organise and assign tasks. Automatically created tasks ensure that nothing will be lost or forgotten.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Developers have clear requirements and a known path when further clarification is needed. Development is TDD or BDD, depending on requirements with a clear path to completion of any task.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Continuous integration servers can check out and run a uSDLC driven project. Only activities marked as ready are tested. This allows for incomplete work to be checked in without causing failures on the integration server.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Test staff will have clear goals as the system documentation will match the software being produced. Independent testing can be limited to acceptance as unit and integration tests are clearly documented and controlled by uSDLC.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Technical writers have all the information in the uSDLC document. Their job is in clarification and document analysis - taking a document that grows organically and maintaining a consistent result.</li>
		<li class="li1">
			Support staff get a system that proves that it works to specification with automatic checking to make sure that support changes will not have unexpected impact.</li>
