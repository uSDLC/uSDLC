 <h1>Instrumentation</h1>

<div id="s1" class="editable section"><p>
	Instrumentation is the glue between definition and implementation. It is readable by the audience for the page and by the computer. It also replaces or wraps traditional technical test code.</p>
</div><div id="s5" class="editable section"><h2>
	<span>Definition</span></h2>
<p>
	The long and short of it is that instrumentation is a script written in a computer language that is palatable to the readers of the page. Low level technical pages will have instrumentation scripts readable by developers - often in the same computer language as the target system. High level pages will use more natural language like domain specific languages readable by domain specialists who are likely not to be software developers.</p>

	Creation</h1>
<p>
	A section can create a reference to a child page in one of three ways:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Select&nbsp;<em><strong>New | Instrumentation</strong>&nbsp;</em>from the menu (or type&nbsp;<em><strong>NI</strong></em>)</li>
	<li>
		Select&nbsp;<em><strong>Section | Insert | Above</strong></em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em><strong>Below</strong></em>&nbsp;from the menu (type&nbsp;<em><strong>SIA, SIB</strong></em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em><strong>Ctrl-I, Crtl-A</strong></em>) and choose the second tab, labelled Instrumentation.</li>
	<li>
		Add a link using the editor on an existing section. The last radio button is instrumentation.</li>
</ol>
</div><div id="s6" class="editable section"><h2>
	<span>Instrumentation Type</span></h2>
<p>
	As has been traditional forever in the software community, the file type is defined by the file name extension - the word after the final dot.</p>
<p>
	<em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> supports a growing list of computer languages using their standard extensions - java, groovy, js, coffee, ... In addition, domain specific alternatives can also use special extensions - screencast, medical, accounts, ...</p>
<p>
	Select an existing extension from the drop-down, or add a new one following a stop in the title for the form approach and the link name if adding instrumentation from the editor.</p>
