		the link button on the tool-bar. The first field is a <a class="usdlc" href="ListOfReports.geb" id="s12a1"
		                                                         action="runnable">list of reports</a> defined in

	Task Report Location</h1>

	<p>
		While is it possible to generate report pages anywhere, convention is to put them in the home pages chapter.
		When a member is added to the system they are given a home page from a configuration template. In the standard
		configuration this template includes a link to reports relevant to them member - tasks assigned to them, tasks
		completed, etc.</p>

	<p>
		A project manager or team leader may add reports that represent their interest areas. The members area also
		includes a member called&nbsp;<strong>Project</strong>. Here resides reports of general interest.</p>

	<p>
		Clicking on a <a href="/rt/reports/AllTasks.html.groovy" id="s13a0" class="usdlc" action="page">report link</a>
		will <a class="usdlc" href="GenerateTheReport.geb" id="s13a0" action="runnable">generate the report</a> and
		present it for review.</p>
