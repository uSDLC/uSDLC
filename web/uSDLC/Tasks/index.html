	Task Report Creation</h1>

	<p>
		uSDLC comes equipped with a Task Report Actor. You generate a report from a tab on the <a
			href="TaskCreateLinkBox.htmlunit" id="s12a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable">create link box</a> - available
		from the link button on the tool-bar. From here you decide what task states to display.</p>

	<p>
		While is it possible to generate report pages anywhere, convention is to put them in the home pages chapter.
		When a member is added to the system they are given a home page from a configuration template. In the standard
		configuration this template includes a link to reports relevant to them member - tasks assigned to them, tasks
		completed, etc.</p>

	<p>
		A project manager or team leader may add reports that represent their interest areas. The members area also
		includes a member called <strong>Project</strong>. Here resides reports of general interest.</p>
