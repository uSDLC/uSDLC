	uSDLC Enterprise</h1>

	<p>
		uSDLC can also run on any J2EE server (i.e. Glassfish, Tomcat, JBOSS, Jetty, Oracle OC4J, Websphere, etc). See
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_application_servers" id="s3a0">wikipedia</a> for a more
		comprehensive list.</p>

<div id="s4" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	uSDLC Appengine</h1>

	<p>
		There is a hosted solution on Google Appengine. It is useful if your creating a system on the open web and as a
		general launch and documentation site. While the Java Appengine is technically just another J2EE engine, the
		restrictions placed on the cloud and database aspects make it a unique proposition. Because of the lack of a
		file-system, not all actors or facilities are available.</p>
</div>
<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	.NET / Mono</h1>

	<p>
		Mono makes .NET the most ubiqitous environment out there. Technically you can run .NET applications on Windows
		Mobile, the iPhone and Android, Windows, OS/X and Unix as well as the cloud with Azure. uSDLC will interact with
		if not run on all these environments.</p>

	<p>
		uSDLC uses IKVM so that the core code remains the same across version. The advantage is that actors can ignore
		the Java heritage and interact with the .NET framework directly.</p>
