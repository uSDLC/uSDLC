 <h2> No install - just run</h2>

<div id="s1" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"> 
 <p> The stand-alone version is designed for systems that do not have an Internet or repository connection. It is a single uSDLC-full.jar file. Copy it into an empty directory in your project and run it with</p> 
 <blockquote> 
  <p> java -jar uSDLC-full.jar</p> 
 </blockquote> 
 <p> It will unpack itself - by only over-writing files that are newer in the archive than on disk. This way you can update uSDLC on an existing project safely.</p>

<div id="s3" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"> 
 <h3> <a class="usdlc sourceLink succeeded" href="Snapshot.grant" id="s3a0" action="runnable">Snapshot</a></h3> 
 <p> It is possible to take a snapshot of the uSDLC tree at any time and create a self-extracting jar file by running this section. It can be copied to any machine with Java installed and run to create a copy of the current system. The same jar can be copied again at any time. When it is run it will update the uSDLC tree by extracting only the newer files.</p>
