	The Single Install Model</h1>

	<p>
		If you have a Java jre installed you can download a <a class="usdlc" href="SingleExecutableJar.groovy" id="s3a0"
		                                                       action="runnable">single executable</a> uSDLC.jar that
		will unpack and prepare itself for use. Optional components, languages and systems are downloaded as required.
	</p>

	<p>
		For Windows, If you don't have Java installed then you can download a <a class="usdlc"
		                                                                         href="BootstrapLoader.groovy" id="s3a1"
		                                                                         action="runnable">bootstrap loader</a>.
		When run it will create the environment needed by uSDLC, download the executable jar and run it. All Unix
		varients will have a version of java available. "<em>java -jar usdlc</em>" is enough to unpack and run uSDLC.
	</p>

	<p>
		Local configurations and optional components need only be set up on one machine. Additional machines once added
		to the<a class="usdlc" href="USDLCWebUpdate.groovy" id="s3a2" action="runnable"> uSDLC web will update</a>
		themselves as needed.</p>

<div id="s2" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Running the Server</h1>

	<p>
		Once the system has been unpacked you have access to the start script in the uSDLC root directory. Just type
		uSDLC on the command line and the server will <a class="usdlc" href="StartUsingDefaultValues.groovy" id="s2a0"
		                                                 action="runnable">start using default values</a>.</p>

	<p>
		If the uSDLC server is already running on the same port, <a
			href="TheRunningInstanceIsStoppedBeforeTheNewOneStarts.groovy" id="s2a1" class="usdlc" action="runnable">the
		running instance is stopped before the new one starts</a>. This is useful if you change libraries or other
		cached code or data.</p>

<div id="s4" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Running the Client</h1>

	<p>
		uSDLC is browser based. It should work correctly from any modern offering that supports JQuery. When the server
		starts it gives the host address to use. Using this address the server can be accessed from any machine on the
		same network.</p>

	<p>
		The browser can be pointed to any page in the document by giving it's full address. This address can be copied
		to the clipboard by right-clicking on the page title and saving it from the context menu. By default the page
		will open in a uSDLC decoration page. If, however, the command line option <a href="ActionRun.htmlunit"
		                                                                              id="s4a0" class="usdlc"
		                                                                              action="runnable"><em>action=run</em></a>
		is added, the page will be run after loading.</p>

<div id="s5" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Headless Operations</h1>

	<p>
		uSDLC can be treated as a service by adding the command line option <a class="usdlc" href="ModeServer.groovy"
		                                                                       id="s5a0" action="runnable"><em>mode=server</em></a>.
		Headless operation means that a browser is not needed to perform the operations. The default response is HTML.
		Use the <em>format </em>option:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<a class="usdlc" href="FormatHtml.groovy" id="s5a1" action="runnable"><em>format=html</em></a>: Output will
			be sent to the browser as it is created. It will look like plain human-readable text with some decorations.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a class="usdlc" href="FormatXml.groovy" id="s5a2" action="runnable"><em>format=xml</em></a>: Output is in
			XML for consumption by another program - such as a contiuous build system.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a class="usdlc" href="FormatText.groovy" id="s5a3" action="runnable"><em>format=text</em></a>: Output is
			plain text. Useful if running with curl or save to a file.
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
