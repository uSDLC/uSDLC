	uSDLC and Software Design</h3>
<p>
	When the dust settles and I look at all the jobs I have done is the SDLC, I still consider myself primarily a software designer. It is the support that uSDLC provides for software design that is, for me, the most exciting aspect.</p>
<p>
	I have a problem - and it is one I have not been able to see my way through. It is around communication. I can send a uSDLC driven design page to interested parties (vision holder, owner, architect, BA, etc) and they will file it with the other artifacts. If they ar dilligent they may read it and send me comments. But they don't get it. I can sit down with them for 5 minutes and the light will go on.</p>
<p>
	A uSDLC document is a living part of the application - through all the development cycles and into production. A sign-off on a uSDLC design document is a sign-off on what will reach production. Any less will automatically raise issues - any more is an unjustified expense.</p>
<p>
	I am not too worried about projects using uSDLC. The benefits become obvious to all quickly - and the automated task system will ensure that everyone is kept informed of when they need to provide input.</p>
<p>
	My problem is in how to tell people who don't use uSDLC why it would help them in their projects. Any explanation I come up with is too complex and the benefits, while huge, are unclear to the uninitiated.</p>
<p>
	In my next article or two I will walk through a design process using uSDLC. Perhaps with your help I can find a way of simplifying describing the benefits.</p>

	uSDLC and Software Design &nbsp;- The Framework</h1>
<p>
	I have talked about the rules of three (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three" id="s7a0">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three</a>) before. For my last few projects I have used it as a template when starting the design. It is more of a guide than a rule...</p>

<p>
	One of the outstanding tasks for uSDLC is to be able to create a project with a choice of template - one of which will be this one.</p>
</div><div id="s8" class="editable section"><h1>
	uSDLC and Software Design - Finer Detail</h1>
<p>
	Iterative divide-and-conquer will eventually leave the designer with pages defining single, possibly indivisible, pieces of functionality. It doesn't matter if the subject is a user interface, business functionality or anything else - the approach is similar.</p>
<p>
	I will often use a bullet point list to outline the functionality provided. Once I am happy that I have covered all aspects, I use a uSDLC command to split the list into separate sections. The list becomes the title pointing to an instrumentation addendum.</p>
<p>
	Adding text to each section can be kept lite. Just say enough to explain the functionality, just as if you were discussing it with the project visionary or business analyst. Most of the description, detail and restrictions are documented in the instrumentation section - information that is readable to both the business representatives and the computer.</p>
<p>
	An example may make it clearer. The first page we are likely to tackle on a web based system would be for authorisation and authentication. On that page, the first section is likely to describe each type of user the system will cater for. On a large system, this would be a page in it's own right.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Development Users</strong></p>
<p>
	For development to proceed we need a set of users - for both manual and automatic testing. The groups are the same as for production use. A user in the test group can do special actions, but cannot, by design, change production data.</p>
<pre>create group 'administator'
create group 'operator'
create group 'test'

create user admin, groups: 'test', 'administrator', 'operator'
create user oper, groups: 'test', 'operator'
create user test, groups: 'test', 'administrator', 'operator'</pre>
<p>
	As you can see above, the prose is to help the reader understand what we are trying to do. The instrumentation is human readable. It not only clearly defines the system, but can be understood by anyone with domain knowledge. A business owner may, for example, look at it and note that we need an operations manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Once the interested parties have been involved in iterative feedback, have them sign on - in blood preferably. The instrumentation will drive the newly created system. It should describe functionality, restrictions and edge cases where they are known. Whatever it says, the system will do - feedback is king. When the customer comes back later and complains that the system doesn't do Y, it is easy to prove whether Y was ever accounted for - and if it was it will be implemented or the instrumentation will fail.</p>
<p>
	The next article will extend the above example, while the one after that will discuss how to turn instrumentation into something your application will understand.</p>
</div><div id="s9" class="editable section synopsis"><h1>
	uSDLC and Software Design - an example</h1>
<p>
	A practical starting point is authorisation and authentication - as most systems rely on knowledge of the operator.</p>
<p>
	The same technique of divide and conquer works inside the page. First I create a bullet point list from what I have learnt that I will need:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Development Users</li>
	<li>
		Authentication and Authorisation Method</li>
	<li>
		Authorisation Check</li>
	<li>
		Authorise Administrator</li>
	<li>
		Authorise Operator</li>
	<li>
		Test Instrumentation</li>
	<li>
		Auditing</li>
</ul>
<p>
	uSDLC allows me to split a list into separate sections with the text as the heading and linked to an instrument block. It is a good idea to edit each section and document the reason for the section. Instrumentation, like code, tells us how but rarely why. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
	<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; ">
		<em><a class="usdlc sourceLink" href="Auditing.webDriver" id="s12a0" action="runnable">Auditing</a></em></h3>
	<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-size: medium; ">
		<em>The audit log includes logging in and all page views, successful or unsuccessful.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Now to filling in the instrumentation block. These are a list of simple statements that fully define the section while remaining readable to domain specialists as well as the computer:</p>
<blockquote>
	<pre>set audit log checkpoint
login oper
check audit log oper 'log in'
browse '/oper'
check audit log oper 'view /oper'
browse '/admin'
check audit log oper 'FAILED: view /admin'
logout oper
check audit log oper 'log out'</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Train your domain specialists to not ignore instrumentation as 'code'. If they can't understand it, then it is still not good enough. What they sign off on here is what will work in production. It will grow - either in the instrumentation block or as new sections or pages - as more information becomes available. With luck this will happen with the domain specialist reviews, but it may happen later when the working system pages are run through their paces. Get each change signed off so expectations meet actuality.</p>
<p>
	Next blog I will discuss activating the instrumentation.</p>
</div><div id="s10" class="editable section"><h1>
	The argument for domain specific languages</h1>
<p>
	There is a gap between how we communicate with each other and how we tell a computer what to do. As software becomes more powerful this gap is, in some areas, larger, not smaller. It is far easier to ask Google a natural language question than the search engine rules of a decade ago, but when it comes to having a computer help with less common tasks we have to rely on software developers to write programs that tend to be 'one size fits all'. For example:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		My A/C allows me to set all the zones to specific temperature, or off. It does not change from vent to heating/cooling. So, I have to train the family to go to two separate menus to do a single function. Wasn't it repetitive tasks that computers were to help with?</li>
	<li>
		Oh, you want a computer example? Every time I create a new spreadsheet in Google docs and enter a dollar figure, it shows the result in pounds. An english/uk dictionary and a GMT of -10 does not mean that we use pounds in Australia.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Why do I say the gap is larger? Twenty years ago those in the more technical domains such as engineering and science would write their own software to help with their work. Today computers and computer languages are so much more complex that they need specialist to write their software. That's ok as the results are often better. The problem arises when the domain specialist needs something not foreseen. They have to get the specialist in again - if the original developers are available - if the source is up to date - if there is budget.</p>
<p>
	I blame the GUI and WYSIWYG :) I will use my a/c as an example - although the same problems exist for your accounts program or your bill paying web-site. I can set my a/c to vent, heat, cool or auto. Auto shuts everything down if the house is at temperature. What I really want is cool if the temperature is above 24 degrees, heating if below 18 degrees and venting otherwise.</p>
<p>
	In the modern world of the easy-to-use GUI I am out of luck. This is why many services like Google apps or Facebook provide an API. Unfortunately to use them you need to cross the line from domain specialist to software developer.</p>
<p>
	What is needed, along with the GUI, is a way of expressing more complex requirements in a language the domain specialist undertands. Enter the concept of a DSL or domain specific language. I suspect that one of the most common used DSLs is also one of the most difficult to grasp - the spreadsheet formula editor. Imagine a spreadsheet without a DSL - behaving like other GUI applications we use. We could highlight blocks of numbers and sum them, but would spreadsheets be as common if they were so limited?</p>
<p>
	Next week I will talk about what a DSL is and why they are not in common use.</p>
</div><div id="s13" class="editable section"><h1>
	What is a DSL?</h1>
<p>
	Firstly, I believe that all computer languages are domain specific. For most modern languages the domain is <em>'Computer Science'</em>. This is good because it gives software designers and developers better tools to cope with the complexities of modern requirements. It is also bad because the code we produce is incomprehensible to specialists in another domain.</p>
<p>
	So, what do I think is a DSL?</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		A DSL must be clearly readable by the domain expert.</li>
	<li>
		It does not have to be natural language, although for many domains that helps.</li>
	<li>
		The only scaffolding visible is domain scaffolding, not computer science.</li>
	<li>
		It must be complete enough to meet the domain needs - and no more complex than that.</li>
	<li>
		It is easy to create and edit.</li>
	<li>
		Version control and change auditing must be implicit but available for stability to be acceptable.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	There are many good examples that meet the first four requirements, but the last two are less understood. Without these, DSL penetration will be limited. Unless a domain expert can use a DSL as easily as a point-and-click interface, they will not take the time. If changes are not monitored so we can see effects we would want the resulting DSLs in production.</p>
<p>
	I am working on both of these problems for uSDLC this year.</p>
<p>
	So, what is a DSL? It is a language that can be read by the domain specialist and also by the computer so that the domain specialist gets the response they anticipate.</p>
