	uSDLC Tools for Developers</h1>

<div id="s1" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Developers live by their tools. This section lists tools that help them use their other tools.</p>
</div>
<div id="s2" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Curl</h1>

	<p>
		This is not really a tool but a convenience function. Developers are encouraged to write the tests in the uSDLC
		system prior to writing the production code. These tests are embedded in the documentation. For convenience it
		is better to be able to run the tests from the IDE or command line. Fortunately this is easy with groovy.</p>

	<p>
		Select <a href="CopyUrl.geb" id="s2a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable"><em>copy url </em></a>from the context
		menu when hovering over an actor, section or page heading. Edit <a href="/Curl.geb" id="s2a1" class="usdlc"
		                                                                   action="runnable">Curl.groovy</a> in the
		uSDLC web root and paste in the URL. Now you can run Curl from your IDE or command line and see the results
		without having to switch to a uSDLC window.</p>
</div>
<div id="s5" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<a href="Database/index.html" id="s5a0" class="usdlc" action="page">Database</a></p>
</div>
<div id="s3" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Logging</h1>

	<p>
		Your application may have a complete logging system. Your actors only need a more basic tool. Anything written
		to the standard error stream will display on the uSDLC server console. For convenience, Groovy and Groovy based
		DSLs can call <a href="Log.groovy" id="s3a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable">log</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="s4" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Timings</h1>

	<p>
		Use the <a class="usdlc" href="TimerClass.groovy" id="s4a0" action="runnable">Timer class</a> if you want to
		measure how long a task takes. The time is always measured from instantiation. The toString() method returns the
		elapsed time into human readable form - hours, minutes and seconds or milliseconds. Timings can also be recorded
		to a long for later review.</p>
