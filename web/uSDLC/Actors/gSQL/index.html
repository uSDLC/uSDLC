	Core database systems are more commonly SQL access based than any other. While the overheads of yet another
	interpreter and ridiculously complicated queries cause massive performance problems, SQL provide unrivalled
	flexibility. uSDLC has H2 embedded. It is used internally for task processing. It is also of use to uSDLC clients
	for anything from application testing to data migration.</p>
</div>
<div id="s2" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><p>
	Primary access to SQL is through a Groovy DSL - chosen by using a gql extension. The entire Groovy DSL interface is
	available from the script without preface. In addition there is a basic connection system <a class="usdlc"

	database</a>(). It is not necessary to close database connections as by default they are closed at the end of the
	exchange before the results are returned to the browser.</p>

	Performing a simple query</h1>

	<p>
		The following examples come from the groovy codehaus tutorial, with examples modified to provide a working
		activity. This <a class="usdlc" href="SimpleQuery.gsql" id="s5a0" action="runnable">simple query</a> will list
		each actor with comments - one per line.</p>

<div id="s6" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Retrieving a single value from DB</h1>

	<p>
		If all you need is a value of one or a few columns of a <a action="runnable" class="usdlc" href="SingleRow.gsql"
		                                                           id="s6a0">single row</a> in the database, you could
		do the folllowing.</p>

<div id="s7" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Inserts, Updates and Deletes</h1>

	<p>
		<a class="usdlc" href="Inserts.gsql" id="s7a0" action="runnable">Inserts</a>&nbsp;and deletes use prepared
		statements whether explicitly, by named method or by the use of Groovy GStrings.</p>
</div>
<div id="s8" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Query Results</h1>

	<p>
		You can return <a href="RowResults.gsql" id="s8a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable">row results</a> directly or
		transfer them to a simple data transfer object.</p>
</div>
<div id="s9" class="editable section synopsis" contextmenu="section"><h1>
	Running Scripts</h1>

	<p>
		Creation, maintenance and migration tasks are often better performed by having SQL scripts in their own files
		for execution. GSQL provides a <a href="RunScript.gsql" id="s9a0" class="usdlc" action="runnable">runScript</a>()
		method where all you need to supply is the script name. The script can reside on the classpath, in a zip file or
		on the file system.</p>

<div id="s3" class="editable section" contextmenu="section"><p>
	<a class="usdlc" href="Setup.gsql" id="s3a0" action="runnable">Setup</a> - <a class="usdlc" href="Teardown.gsql"
	                                                                              id="s3a1"
	                                                                              action="runnable">Teardown</a></p>

	<p>
		The setup creates a simple database to query with the names of actors with fields for first name, last name and
		comments. As we keep the database in memory, all we need do is close it and it will go away.</p>
