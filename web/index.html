	We, as a group, are doing a good job of putting processes in place that improve the performance and reliability of
	phases in the Software Development Life-cycle. The communications between the phases, however are typically
	unwieldy, expensive and ineffective. Usdlc is an attempt to address these issues by integrating best-of breed
	processes from the different phases in a platform that provides facilities for better communication.</p>
