	This project template follows the traditional software development life-cycle phases fairly closely, while expecting
	an agile iterative approach to implementation.</p>

	<a class="usdlc" href="Vision/index.html" id="s11a0">The Vision</a></h1>

	<p>
		The project owner is often, but not always the vision holder. The vision holder should create and maintain this
		section. While most of the work recording the vision will be complete before the project starts, updates should
		be made as the vision matures with the project. Enter your project vision as a short clear paragraph and use the
		link above to provide more structured details.</p>

	<p>
		Having a vision is a wonderful thing. Making it reality is hard work. The first step is about viability.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			A business case is the information that describes the justification for a project. A business case is built
			on evidence derived from feasibility studies or impact analysis to support project objectives. <sub>(<a

			In requirements engineering, requirements elicitation is the practice of obtaining the requirements of a
			system from users, customers and other stakeholders. The practice is also sometimes referred to as
			requirements gathering.<sub> (<a href="http://127.0.0.1:9000/uSDLC/index.html"

		Define how the system should look and behave based on the requirements gathered in (2). The result is the input
		and output of the system. Screens as wire-frames or prototypes, reports and other interfaces to humans or other

	<p>
		The TA is often completed by a technical BA. It is about reviewing the technical environment for the system. It
		is about the hardware, network and physical interfaces to other systems. The challenge is to fit into the
		existing systems where possible and to define the needs for extension.</p>
	<blockquote>

	<p>
		Given the information and constraints in the above sections design the software system. This consists of
		component descriptions and relationships, component interface definitions and recommendations of proof of
		concept code for the more difficult sections. At a minimum the output is a block diagram and a design document.
		At the most it is empty classes that define both the interface and functionality for the system down to a
		defined level of complexity.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			Software design is a process of problem-solving and planning for a software solution. After the purpose and

		This section is most commonly called testing. As testing is now being considered &nbsp;to start &nbsp;earlier in
		the SDLC, we call this section verification. Here representatives of the client verify that the system as it is

		At this point in history there are very few truly green-field projects. Even systems that meet new needs will

	<a href="Support/index.html" id="s11a11" class="usdlc">Support</a></h1>

	<a href="MinorUpgrades/index.html" id="s12a12" class="usdlc">Minor Upgrades</a></h1>

	<p>
		Release deadlines often leave less critical parts of the system unimplemented or ready for release. Sometimes a
		project plans a suite of upgrades. System use often leads to the discovery of additional useful or even critical
		functionality.</p>

		At some point the system will become difficult or impossible to upgrade to meet the growing needs of the client.
		Other reasons for reaching end of life include</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Aging hardware that cannot be replaced with a compatible system.
		</li>
		<li>
			Security concerns.
		</li>
		<li>
			Infrastructure, application server or database upgrades that are not compatible with the existing system.
		</li>
		<li>
			Inability to find support staff or upgrade developers willing to admit to being able to support the old
			technology.
		</li>
		<li>
			New technologies such as client-server to web or mobile device support.
		</li>
