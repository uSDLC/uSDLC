	This section is 100% client interaction. For a re-implementation requirements gathering starts with reviewing the existing system, recording the inadequacies that caused the re-implementation, what could be improved and what should stay the same. For green-field and re-implementation a BA works with all interested parties to record requirements, preferences and avoidances.</p>
