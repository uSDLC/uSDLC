		Page Editing</h2>

	<p>
		Pages are edited by section. Click on a section and it will highlight. Either select edit from the context menu or if the page is in edit mode you can double-click. The HTML editor is a complete word processor. Use any of the functions to brighten up your page. Click the save icon on the tool-bar to send the changes back. If all is well the section will receive the green strip of success.</p>

	Creating New Pages</h3>

	<p>
		Click on the tool-bar link item in the editor. Type in a readable name while leaving the protocol as local. When you save the section the link will be converted to a readable URL. Clicking on the link will move to the new page empty but for the template.</p>

		Inserting New Sections</h3>
