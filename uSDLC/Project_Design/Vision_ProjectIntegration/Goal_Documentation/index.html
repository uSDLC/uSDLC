<h2>
	<span>Traditional Documentation</span></h2>
<p>
	User and reference manuals are usually scheduled, if at all, for the end of a project. The logic is that there is no point writing documentation until the product is complete - or it will only become out-of-date.</p>
<p>
	And then there is the creation. Document writers have to learn the running software without the benefit of documentation and often after key personel have left the project. Often the technical writer has to be a technical tester who has to write as well. The process can be akin to archeology.</p>

	<span><em>uSDLC</em> Documentation</span></h2>
<p>
	<em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> encourages the writing of extremely focussed paragraphs of documentation as part of the behaviour driven design process. When creating a section, use a type of <em>Guide</em>. Encourage all participants to create guide sections when they see a gap. Writing excellence is not needed. It will provide the information a technical writer will need to create better documentation.</p>

	<span>Building a Document</span></h2>
<p>
	So, now we have interesting snippets of documentation all over the place. Here is where technical writing skills really matter - creating a structure and fitting all the pieces into a cohesive whole.&nbsp;<em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em>&nbsp;provides a clipboard. Any section in the interactive document can be copied to the clipboard. Then a reference the contents can be placed on another page. If the original is changed, the references will be updated at the next publishing cycle.</p>

<h1>
	Document Task Generation</h1>
<p>
	<em><strong>uSDLC</strong>&nbsp;</em>generates tasks for pages without guide sections or for instrumentation updates where there has not been a matching update to the guide. It also flags pages that are not referenced in documentation sections.</p>
