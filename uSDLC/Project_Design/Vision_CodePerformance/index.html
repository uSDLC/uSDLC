<br>All tasks are recorded and reviewed for project impact. If integration testing or migration scripts start taking significantly longer, uSDLC raises a task for this to be reviewed.

<br>Continuous performance monitoring is available. If any component starts to perform more slowly during activation or continuous integration then a task will be raised for review.</div></div>
