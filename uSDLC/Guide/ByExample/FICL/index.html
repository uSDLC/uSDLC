	FICL</h1>
<h2>
	Fast Interactive Command Language</h2>
</div> 
<div id="s1" class="editable section"><p>
	<strong>FICL</strong> is a general library for use within other applications. The acronym stands for <strong>F</strong>ast <strong>I</strong>nteractive <strong>C</strong>onfiguration&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>anguage. Most current applications using compiled code use static configuration files as name-value pairs or XML. At the high end, larger application use interpreted languages such as BASIC or Groovy. FICL is designed with a small footprint to provide similar facilities for less endowed environments - such as application servers and mobile devices.</p>
<p>
	For this example we will follow Paul - a contract developer asked to implement an <strong>Android</strong> application that requires some relative complicated workflow, combinations of which will not be known until runtime. The traditional solution is to provide the user with a fixed set of options. With a new application it is not always possible to know which options are needed. The options are to provide a fixed configuration that covers possible options or the ability to add new workflow combinations to the mobile device as their need is discovered. Paul chose to implement <strong>FICL</strong>&nbsp;so that new workflows can be sent to the mobile device as needed.</p>
<p>
	<em>Aside</em>: FICL was developed to provide an optional <strong><em>uSDLC</em>&nbsp;</strong>configuration and command structure for uSDLC instrumentation and testing.</p>

<h2>
	<span>What is a contract developer?</span></h2>
<p>
	For the purposes of this exercise, a contract developer is one or two developers paid to provide a solution. If they are conracted to join or create a team, they fit into another category.</p>

<h2>
	<span>Contract Developer Strengths</span></h2>
<p>
	Contract developers are engaged to bring a project to fruition that the client does not otherwise have the resources to complete. In this role a contract developer provides some compelling advantages:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		The budget is for a specific project so that the contract developer is less likely to be purlioned or diverted to other work.</li>
	<li>
		It is possible to bring in skill-sets that are not available in-house - iOS is a Java shop, for example.</li>
	<li>
		New perspectives - Contract developers will bring in knowledge and ideas that can foster change.</li>
	<li>
		Experience - you can contract experienced contractors without the overhead of keeping them on staff once the need has been met.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
	<span>Contract Developer Weaknesses</span></h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		They can leave unmaintainable or indecipherable code. Even good code can be difficult to maintain without an understanding of the framework and tools used during development.</li>
	<li>
		They do not have as much domain knowledge as staff. Without on-going access to domain experts, contract developers can lose direction and not produce a viable product.</li>
	<li>
		Clients expect the contract develop to design as well as develop. This can lead to results may not meet expectiation.</li>
	<li>
		Developers in general are notoriously bad at communication and documentation.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
	<span>Client responsibilities</span></h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		Provide the contract developer with vision and goals for the project. Verbal and incomplete has to be OK as the client has contracted a developer because they do not have the resources for vision and design documents.</li>
	<li>
		Provide access to domain experts. Domain experts have their own job to do. Adding a project to this work-load is not popular. It is best if it is possible to have domain experts involved in the vision. This only happens if they can see the immediate benefits for their day-to-day work.</li>
	<li>
		Provide environmental requirements - space, hardware, etc.</li>
	<li>
		Create a feed-back structure that while not onerous, does provide the overview needed to keep the project on track. This can be a fortnightly update meeting, but it needs to be interactive so that client and developer can be reasonably confident they are seeing the same outcomes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
	<span>Contract Developer Responsibilities</span></h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		Keep the client informed.</li>
	<li>
		Keep the domain experts involved.</li>
	<li>
		Provide timely results. Use iterative developent and agile practices as a strength, not an excuse.</li>
	<li>
		Provide a product to customer expections with quality and reliability.</li>
	<li>
		Provide sufficient documentation and structure for support and further development at a later time. Documentation needs to include how to set up development and test environments as well as all the other details required to support the project.</li>

<h2>
	<span>Contract Developers and <em>uSDLC</em></span></h2>
<p>
	Owner developers can treat uSDLC as a TDD (Test Driven Development) platform. Contract developers do not have that luxury. They have clients and other stake-holders who must be kept in the loop if the project is to be successful. uSDLC provides</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		A browser based client so that stake-holders can review and provide feedback without interrupting the project flow.</li>
	<li>
		A framework for "Design by Example" or BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) design principles so that design and design decisions are transparent - both for stake-holders and later for support and additional development.</li>
	<li>
		The simplest way to make the smallest possible amount of documentation clear for stake-holders and project members.</li>
	<li>
		A feedback machanism that closes the loop from vision through design to implementation. Stake-holders can see and even create examples that exercises production code and shows that capabilities and features are implemented as requested.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Paul is a core developer for <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em>. If you need help with installation or creating a new project, see the iBundy example or review the how-to section. He has already created a uSDLC document for the Android project. WHen he realises the potential for FICL he creates a new project for this library.</p>
