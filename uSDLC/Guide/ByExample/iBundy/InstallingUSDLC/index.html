<div id="s1" class="editable section"><div>
	<strong>Step one</strong>: download, install and test <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em>. <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> is a JVM based client-server application. The client is any modern browser. The server is designed to be run from a single download without additional installation.</div>

<h2>
	<span>Prerequisites</span></h2>
<p>
	The only prerequisite for <strong><em>uSDLC</em></strong> is a Java runtime (JVM). Bruce is running OS X - which comes with Java pre-installed.</p>

<h2>
	<span>Download</span></h2>
<p>
	Bruce has a choice. He can download a single-file install from <a href="http://usdlc.net/usdlc/home#~uSDLC/usdlc/Environment/Configuration/Installation/USDLCStandAlone@s1" id="s5a7">usdlc.net</a>&nbsp;or he can clone the project from <a href="https://github.com/uSDLC/uSDLC/" id="s5a8">github</a>. The results are identical, but as Bruce is not a Java developer and he does not regularly use GitHub, he finds it easier to download <em>uSDLC-full.jar</em>.</p>
<p>
	Bruce keeps his project source code in directories under <em>~/dev</em>, so he creates a directory <em>~/dev/uSDLC</em> and copies the jar to it.</p>

	Guide</div>
<h2>
	<span>Updates</span></h2>
<p>
	Any time Bruce wants to update uSDLC to the latest version he downloads a new copy of uSDLC-full.jar and overwrites the one in <em>~/dev/uSDLC</em>. When run it will unpack and update only those files that are newer.</p>

	<h2>
		First Run</h2>
	<p>
		Apple has an effective jar launcher, so all Bruce has to do is go to&nbsp;<em>~/dev/uSDLC</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>Finder&nbsp;</strong>and double-click&nbsp;<em>uSDLC-full.har</em>. He will see the directory fill up with all the working files. Then the default browser will open to the local uSDLC home-page. If Bruce wants to see more information he can open the OS X console (<strong>/Applications/Utilities/Console.app</strong>).</p>

<h2>
	<span>Automatic launch</span></h2>
<p>
	Again OS X makes this easy. <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> will be on the dock with the default Java icon. Bruce right-clicks on it and selects the menu <em>Options | Open at Login</em>.</p>
