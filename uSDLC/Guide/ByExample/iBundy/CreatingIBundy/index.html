	<strong>Step two</strong>: create a new project for source and <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em>. A project is known to uSDLC if it is in a known project folder and itself has a <em>usdlc</em> directory. This <em>usdlc</em> directory is the only footprint <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> makes on a project. Under it are HTML files and instrumentation scripts that provide full definition for the project with or without <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> to interpret them.</div>

	Bruce looks at the uSDLC screen and sees that the only project on the left is <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em>. He knows he as other projects in <em>~/dev</em>, but he can't see them. He decides to add one at ~/dev/raphael. From the <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> menu he selects <em><u>P</u>roject | <u>N</u>ew</em>. Bruce types <strong>r</strong> for raphael and a list of matching projects that are not attached to <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> are displayed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
	<img alt="" src="./NewProject.png"></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">
	He selects <em>raphael</em>&nbsp;and the project tree adjusts to display the new project.</p>

<p>
	Time for the new. Bruce opens <em><u>P</u>roject | <u>N</u>ew</em> again and types <strong>iBundy</strong>. Now he has iBundy in the list also. Drilling in shows that a rudimentary structure already in place. Because Bruce knows what he wants he can go directly to design and ignore the rest.</p>
<h3>
	Templates</h3>
<p>
	Bruce wonders if he can change the structure of a new project so it doesn't include sections he doesn't need. Under <em>uSDLC | Environment | Configuration | Templates | Projects | Default</em> is a layout identical to the new <em><strong>iBundy</strong></em> one. Changing this template will change how a new project looks.</p>
