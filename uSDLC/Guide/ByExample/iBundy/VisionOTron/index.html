	Owner-developer projects usually start in a creative whirl - all ideas, no substance. For Bruce it is no different. All those things that iBundy must or might or could do. Time to write them down before they merge into a muddy shade of confusion and loss.</div>

	A Synopsis</h1>
<p>
	First things first, Bruce clicks on iBundy in the navigator. And up pops a for to fill in for the synopsis. As an owner developer, Bruce is using uSDLC as a sophisticated TDD (test driven development) tool, so design details don't hold much interest. But, for the fun of it he fills in this form.</p>

<h2>
	<span>The First List</span></h2>
<p>
	Given the risk of loss through forgetfullness, the best thing is to list them as the arise - the famous <em>back of a napkin</em> scenario. Actually Bruce use the <em>Notes</em> application on his iPhone. Does that make the iPhone the 21st century napkin? The process was relatively painless. Because Bruce is an owner-developer, the notes only need be meaningful to him. For larger teams they need to be more detailed.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Go to <em>iBundy / Design</em> in the navigator</li>
	<li>
		Select Backlog and press <strong>meta-A</strong> to create a new section.</li>
	<li>
		Note that the form defaults to a section type of <em>Vision</em></li>
	<li>
		Entering a title</li>
	<li>
		Press the&nbsp;<em>New Vision</em>&nbsp;button</li>
	<li>
		Type SE for <em>Section / Edit</em></li>
	<li>
		Type <strong>meta-A Ctrl-8</strong> to replace the contents with a bullet list</li>
	<li>
		start typing</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Hint: Bruce doesn't have to record everything - and it does not need to be in a logical order. It is primarily a brain-dump. It may be labelled vision, but the list will also include benefits and features. Bruce could sort it out later, but for an owner developer this is optional as only he or she need understand it.</p>
<p>
	Hint: Keep the first line short as this will be a title. Use Ctrl-Enter to put more detail on subsequent lines.</p>

	<span>Expanding Vision</span></h2>
<p>
	Bruce types&nbsp;<strong>SSS</strong>&nbsp;to break the vision points up into separate sections with links to child vision pages. He will delete the first section (<strong>SD</strong>) as it is not a valid vision point.</p>
