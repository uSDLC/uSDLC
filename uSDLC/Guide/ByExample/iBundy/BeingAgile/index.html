	Owner-developers have been 'agile' since long before the word was coined. Bruce is no different. The catch is being agile and optimising productivity. It is the same issue facing agile teams of any size.</p>

<h2>
	<span>Cutting to the Chase</span></h2>
<p>
	As an owner developer, Bruce does not report to anyone but himself. The inefficiencies created by limited planning are made up for with time and energy - a part of the passion.</p>
<p>
	Bruce will not make use of the structure <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> provides. He wants to cut code and create product. He holds the higher purpose in his head, along with benefits and value. Whether this is good or bad is immaterial. It is the way he has chosen to work.</p>
<p>
	This means he will go straight from vision statements to features and scenarios. Even this is a challenge for most owner-developers who would prefer to cut code first and ask questions later. Bruce, however, has decided to dip his toes in the BDD water by starting with defining features and creating scenarios before writing code.</p>

<h2>
	<span>How is this being Agile?</span></h2>
<p>
	By using some of the principles behind Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) and Test Driven Development (TDD), Bruce is starting on the path prescribed by most agile proponents. These techniques in themselves are not agile, but they do make agile practices more palatable to product owners. Since Bruce is his own product owner he does not need these practices for those purposes. Instead he is giving up some freedom to</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		provide a perspective that will keep him more on track to reach a project release sooner</li>
	<li>
		create a product that is more reliable and requires less support and bug fixing once released</li>
</ol>
<p>
	This is not being agile, but with a little help Bruce is more likely than most to create a complete, marketable and reliable product in the amount of time that his patience and passion will allow.</p>
