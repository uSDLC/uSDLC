	iBundy is an <strong>iPhone application</strong> for recording working time. It is a modern analog of the old bundy clock. Apart from manually clocking in and out, the iPhone records environmental information that you can use as a reminder for unrecorded actions. When you leave the office for lunch or at the end of the day, you move out of Wifi range. When building your time-sheet you can review and flag out-of-office events as work or break.</p>
<p>
	For the purposes of this example, we will create the application from the perspective of an <strong>owner-developer</strong>. Anyone who comes up with a concept and sees it all the way to release doing all the work involved is an owner-developer. Sometimes it is a partnership, but most often it is a one creative person putting in his or her heart and soul.</p>

<h2>
	<span>Owner Developer Strengths</span></h2>
<p>
	A fair proportion of software products that you use today were originally conceived of and implemented by an owner developer. Why is that?</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Low overheads</strong>: Moving from concept to release takes little more than a time investment - putting it in range of anyone who likes to code.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Low risk</strong>: Until an owner-developer drops the day job, the time investment will not cost the house.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Efficient communication</strong>: The costs of communicating concepts, designs, practises and experience are just not there - or more accurately happen and the speed of synapse.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Flexibility</strong>: Without expectations of others, an owner-developer is free to try new approaches and ideas.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Creativity</strong>: Creativity means new ideas. It is difficult to prove a creative idea is viable without building at least a first version and see how it is accepted. Very few investors when weighing cost against benefits will consider something they can't quantify. An owner developer can because they don't have to spend time on a balance sheet and they do have an emotional investment in the idea.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
	<span>Owner Developer Weaknesses</span></h2>
<p>
	On the other hand, most owner developers fail to finish. Here are some of the reasons:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Too ambitious</strong>: Most owner developers start a project from a concept and move directly to implementation. Without other parties to satisfy, the design can remain cerebral where it can grow and adapt. This often works well - except for a perspective issue. An idea that looks like it should take six months can take 6 years - a fact we would have known if we had taken the time to jot down the tasks and add some guesstimates. Of course most owner developers would be to intimidated to start if they knew what they were really taking on. So, perhaps it is better to have a high failure rate than lose the great ideas that do make it.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Commitment</strong>: The creative spark is important, but for software development it takes 99.9% perspiration to make the 0.1% inspiration valuable. That is a long road to hold your vision and belief for.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Direction</strong>: It is easy to get immersed and spend an inordinate amount of time on features that are either dead ends or not needed for the first release of the product. This is one of the risks associated with the strength of flexibility.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Organisation</strong>: It takes effort to keep all aspects of a complex project in your head. While this effort is a lower overhead than that involved in a team project, it is still significant. It also leads to things being lost - from great ideas to potential pitfalls.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Product</strong> <strong>reliability</strong>: is related to organisation deficiencies and the low manpower investment. Coding without formal design leads to gaps in implementation, particularly with error checking. In addition one person has to choose between fixing bugs and adding that new feature. As the product increases in popularity the bug fixing can take all your time.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Marketing</strong>: Let's face it. Software developers are mostly technical geeks with poor communication skills. If your product is something new, how do you tell people what it really does? If the idea is obvious there will already be a hundred versions around. If it is truly unique, why will your market know to look?</li>
</ol>

<h2>
	<span>Owner Developers and uSDLC</span></h2>
<p>
	<em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> is designed to address many of the weaknesses that plague owner developers while minimising the effect on the strengths.</p>
<p>
	I use the word minimise intentionally. The fastest way to produce something is to hold the design in your head and start coding. The risk is that you may end up with a product that is hard to maintain, hard to add features and buggy. You also risk not seeing your target until you have developed the wrong product.</p>
<p>
	<em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em>&nbsp;supports the use of <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/Introduction" id="s6a7">behaviour driven development</a> (BDD). It will help you sketch out your design with the minimum of documentation overhead. <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> also has an easy to use test driven design framework that will make this approach easy no matter what techology you are developing with.</p>
<p>
	In my experience, filling out the design adds less that a 5% overhead to the project - while it makes it much easier to see the gaps and to plan what to do next. <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html" id="s6a8">The test driven development</a> (TDD) component of BDD is more expensive. It doubles the development effort. This sounds like a lot, but you get it all back with tenfold interest during the maintenance phase. As a more immediate bonus you will have more confidence in the operation of your software - and you won't be wasting time finding bugs introduced by supposedly unrelated code changes. Oh, and when you decide to add a new feature, it is way easier.</p>

<p>
	Bruce, our owner-developer, does contract development in his day job. As a contract developer he is paid based on a timesheet he produced. After looking at all the currently available options for the iPhone, he has decided to write one that meets his requirements.</p>
