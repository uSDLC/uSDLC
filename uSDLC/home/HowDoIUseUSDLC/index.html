	Easily. <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> provides helping hands to guide team members through vision recording, requirements gathering, design, development and testing. At any time a team member can forego organised process, skip unneeded operations or create content directly with the built-in WYSIWYG editor. Developers can work within their IDEs, running scenarios just as they would run other unit tests. With the structure and organisation <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> provides, documentation can be very light while still retaining all the information required.</p>
