 <h1>Who Benefits</h1> 
 <h2></h2> 
</div> 
<div id="s1" class="editable section"><p>
	<strong>Product owner</strong>&nbsp;receives a more reliable result that more closely matches the vision. With full transparency, discrepencies can be identified and dealt with early.</p>
<p>
	The <strong>project manager</strong>&nbsp;can review progress and assign priorities as easily for agile as for waterfall projects.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Business analysts</strong> can record their findings and examples in such a way that they will be used to test the production code - ensuring that learnings at the analysis phase will result in matching production code.</p>
<p>
	A <strong>product designer</strong> will have all the analysis discoveries and example, and can build them into the solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Architects</strong> will be able to tie requirements documents to instrumentation to ensure that architectural needs are not forgotten in the production code.</p>
<p>
	The <strong>team lead</strong>&nbsp;can prioritise and assign work directly from uSDLC. Completed tasks show up as soon as they are checked in.</p>
<p>
	The <strong>Software Designer</strong>&nbsp;has the information on hand for high and low level designs. The results include generating scenarios the will keep the design in line with earlier stake-holders and the resulting production system.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Developers</strong> will be presented with a clear task. Once a scenario is implemented, the task is complete. If additional information is required, the task can be followed up the tree all the way back to the vision to find details - and who specified said detail.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Test specialists</strong> have more information to work with. The task is more about creating scenarios to fill gaps than repetitive testing.</p>
<p>
	The <strong>technical writer</strong> can spend more time writing and less time having to troll for the required information from other teams. All the information will be available in <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em>. It needs to be organised and clarified for training, guides and other technical documents.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Support teams</strong>&nbsp;will have a full picture of the software they are supporting. They will be able to run the instrumentation to ensure continued correct operation after changes. They can add scenarios to cover post-release problems so that once they are fixed they won't resurface.</p>
