<h2>
	<span>What is BDD</span></h2>
<p>
	<a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/" id="s4a6">Dan North</a> coined the term BDD for behaviour-driven development. Initially he was considering it as an extension of test-driven development. After further consideration, it became obvious it was a way to view both analysis and acceptance testing as well. Put simply, defining and verifying behaviour is far more powerful than creating and running tests.</p>
<p>
	Dan recognised the value of ubiqitous language as described in the book <em>Domain Driven Design</em>. His choice of <strong><em>As a ... // I want ... // so that ...</em></strong> is valueable in analysis and design in providing focus.</p>
<p>
	He then hooks the world of words with that of code with scenarios - <em><strong>given ... // when... then ...</strong></em>&nbsp;These are domain language //natural language statements that are interpreted by the system to interact with the system under development. Confirming behaviour - or running a test under the old parlance.</p>
<p>
	Dan defines BDD from a software developer perspective, with a focus on features and scenarios to close the gap between design and development. <em><strong>uSDLC</strong>&nbsp;</em>needs to cover the full spectrum from vision holder to support. To help span the requirements, design, development and testing, <em><strong>uSDLC</strong>&nbsp;</em>uses the breakdown documented by&nbsp;<a href="http://lizkeogh.com/2012/06/01/bdd-in-the-large/" id="s4a7">Elizabeth Keogh</a>&nbsp;in her blog on BDD in the large. She attributes the structure to Chris Matts, a business analyst who worked with Dan North extending BDD beyond the development tier. It is an integral part of feature injection.</p>
<p>
	This allows for a deeper structure with layers for <em>project, vision, goals, capabilities, features </em>and<em> scenarios</em>. For smaller projects,&nbsp;<em>project, vision, features&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;scenarios</em>&nbsp;prove an adequate breakdown. It appears that the same ubitquitous language (<strong><em>As a ... // I want ... // so that ...</em></strong>) works for the earlier breakdown as well as for features. <em><strong>uSDLC</strong>&nbsp;</em>is designed so that the language can be changed when better statements are found.</p>
