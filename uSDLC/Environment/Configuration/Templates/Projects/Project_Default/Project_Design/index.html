	Here lies the core of the software development lifecycle - from high level concepts and design through connecting to production code with scenarios. The structure provides a natural framework for <em>design by decomposition</em> - a superset of specification by example. Start with an overview description of the project or sub-project. From this you can discern vision points. These points lead to concrete goals. To reach goals the resulting software will need capabilities. Capabilities are made up of features and features are described by examples in the form of scenarios.</p>
