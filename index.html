	<span style="font-size: 24px; "><img alt="" src="globe-pearl.png" style="float: left; ">What if every pearl of knowledge gathered by the analysts and architects was an integral part of the development/test groups in the SDLC?&nbsp;What if there were no artefact documents gathering electronic dust?&nbsp;What if the support team could trust that the documentation accurately represented the code in the running system? The uSDLC project is the core of an interactive manual for implement Lean and Agile methodology across the software development life-cycle.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<a action="page" class="usdlc" href="WhatIsUSDLC" id="s15a0">What is uSDLC?</a></h1>
<div class="inclusion" id="s15a0_inclusion"><p>
	<em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> is an open source, platform independent application for use by all members of a software development project. It provides direct connections between vision, design and the production code. There are processes to support, but not enforce, the use of behaviour driver development. It supports living lean documentation practices.</p><p>
	<em><strong>uSDLC</strong>&nbsp;</em>helps a software project be successful, more economical with a more reliable result without adding load to the members of the team.</p></div></div><div id="s18" class="editable section synopsis"><h1 class="sectionType">
	<a class="usdlc" href="WhyWouldIUseUSDLC" id="s18a0" action="page">Why would I use <strong><em>uSDLC</em></strong>?</a></h1>
<div class="inclusion" id="s18a0_inclusion"><p>
	As an <strong>owner developer</strong> you will be able to separate design from development (a left brain/right brain thing). You will also get a more reliable product that will require less upkeep after release.</p><p>
	As a <strong>contract developer</strong>&nbsp;you will also get a web based system that will provide your customer with confidence that the result will meet the vision.</p><p>
	As a member of a small <strong>multi-skilled team</strong>&nbsp;you will be able to separate your areas of concern while keeping them connected to each other and the result.</p><p>
	As a member of a <strong>structured team</strong> you will have access to all the information from all the other teams in a manner focussed to your requirement.</p></div></div><div id="s16" class="editable section synopsis"><h1 class="sectionType">
	<a action="page" class="usdlc" href="WhoBenefits" id="s16a0">Who Benefits?</a></h1>
<div class="inclusion" id="s16a0_inclusion"><p>
	<strong>Product owner</strong>&nbsp;receives a more reliable result that more closely matches the vision. With full transparency, discrepencies can be identified and dealt with early.</p><p>
	The <strong>project manager</strong>&nbsp;can review progress and assign priorities as easily for agile as for waterfall projects.</p><p>
	<strong>Business analysts</strong> can record their findings and examples in such a way that they will be used to test the production code - ensuring that learnings at the analysis phase will result in matching production code.</p><p>
	A <strong>product designer</strong> will have all the analysis discoveries and example, and can build them into the solution.&nbsp;</p><p>
	<strong>Architects</strong> will be able to tie requirements documents to instrumentation to ensure that architectural needs are not forgotten in the production code.</p><p>
	The <strong>team lead</strong>&nbsp;can prioritise and assign work directly from uSDLC. Completed tasks show up as soon as they are checked in.</p><p>
	The <strong>Software Designer</strong>&nbsp;has the information on hand for high and low level designs. The results include generating scenarios the will keep the design in line with earlier stake-holders and the resulting production system.</p><p>
	<strong>Developers</strong> will be presented with a clear task. Once a scenario is implemented, the task is complete. If additional information is required, the task can be followed up the tree all the way back to the vision to find details - and who specified said detail.</p><p>
	<strong>Test specialists</strong> have more information to work with. The task is more about creating scenarios to fill gaps than repetitive testing.</p><p>
	The <strong>technical writer</strong> can spend more time writing and less time having to troll for the required information from other teams. All the information will be available in <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em>. It needs to be organised and clarified for training, guides and other technical documents.</p><p>
	<strong>Support teams</strong>&nbsp;will have a full picture of the software they are supporting. They will be able to run the instrumentation to ensure continued correct operation after changes. They can add scenarios to cover post-release problems so that once they are fixed they won't resurface.</p></div></div><div id="s17" class="editable section synopsis"><h1 class="sectionType">
	<a class="usdlc" href="HowDoIUseUSDLC" id="s17a0" action="page">How do I use <strong><em>uSDLC</em></strong>?</a></h1>
<div class="inclusion" id="s17a0_inclusion"><p>
	Easily. <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> provides helping hands to guide team members through vision recording, requirements gathering, design, development and testing. At any time a team member can forego organised process, skip unneeded operations or create content directly with the built-in WYSIWYG editor. Developers can work within their IDEs, running scenarios just as they would run other unit tests. With the structure and organisation <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> provides, documentation can be very light while still retaining all the information required.</p></div></div><div id="s19" class="editable section synopsis"><h1 class="sectionType">
	<a class="usdlc" href="WhereIsUSDLCSuitable" id="s19a0" action="page">Where is <strong><em>uSDLC</em></strong> suitable?</a></h1>
<div class="inclusion" id="s19a0_inclusion"><p>
	<em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em>&nbsp;has been specifically designed for single developers up to small teams. Since a large project is made of small teams, it will adapt there also.&nbsp;<em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> will run on any standard platform - windows, OS X, Linux or Unix varient. Scenarios can be instrumented in most application types. We provide sample projects for web applications, iOS, Windows programs and others. There is enough information here to adapt to any form of application.</p></div></div><div id="s20" class="editable section synopsis"><h1 class="sectionType">

<div class="inclusion" id="s20a0_inclusion"><p>
	<em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> is an open source project. It is build on BDD principles, providing more self-documentation than most open source systems.</p><p>
	The home page provides links to the forum and GitHub issue register.</p><p>
