	<title>Unifying the Software Development Life-cycle</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>The Vision</h3>
There is a lot of common process between the difference phases that make up a software development, release and support project. uSDLC is a prototype platform to aid in leveraging activities in one phase to aid in other phases. Some examples are:
<ol>
	<li>Record discoveries and examples found during analysis to leverage behavioural driven development.</li>
	<li>Use the same processes and techniques as BDD for unit and component tests.</li>
	<li>Extend the same methods for data migration and environment installation</li>
	<li>Continuous integration for all these processes</li>
	<li>Maintenance and support tasks</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Platform</h3>
uSDLC runs on a web server and uses the browser as the primary user interface. It comes bundled with a simple web-server to provide a stand-alone application. It can also be easily included in a servlet engine for more sophisticated support around security and load balancing, enterprise packages, etc. uSDLC uses jQuery and ckedit to provide a rich user interface.
<h3>The Interface</h3>
uSDLC is a customisable web site. Any paragraph or section can be edited in-place using ckeditor.
<h3>Networking</h3>
Many uSDLC functions are inherently multiple platform - from exercising application servers to deployment for test, uat and production environments. Support for this requires multiple approaches:
<ol>
	<li>uSDLC is provided in a simple copy and run package. It is possible to tell different instances to act as slaves. On request a master instance can ask for resources to be copied and scripts to be run on any server or work-station in the chain.</li>
	<li>uSDLC includes a lightweight HTTP protocol to work with servers, such as production, where you are not running a full copy of uSDLC. In short you an send commands to a system under test and analyse the results.</li>
	<li>uSDLC includes support routines and documentation to communicate with other systems using protocols such as Telnet, SSH, FTP, SQL, ...</li>
</ol>
<h3>Versioning</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Developers can run uSDLC inside the same version control system as they use for production code and unit test development.</li>
	<li>For a finer grained record of changes, uSDLC provides local history using the google diff-match-patch utilities (http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Scripting</h3>
uSDLC provides support across the board, but in the end the best way to express logic in a flexible way is with a computer language. Many developers prefer to work in a language they are comfortable with. At it's core uSDLC uses actors that can be modified and extended to provide additional functionality. The first release will support most of the jvm based scripting languages:
<ul>
	<li>Jython</li>
	<li>Jruby</li>
	<li>Groovy</li>
	<li>Javascript</li>
	<li>Scala</li>
	<li>Clojure</li>
	<li>Java</li>
</ul>
The intention is to provide an IKVM version so thet uSDLC can also run on .NET and Mono. The, scripting will also be available in:
<ul>
	<li>C#</li>
	<li>VB</li>
	<li>Boo</li>
	<li>Pascal</li>
</ul>
among others.
